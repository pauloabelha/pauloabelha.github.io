# Homeopathy, allodoxia

I’ve often wondered how people manage to believe in homeopathy while also trusting modern medicine. You’ll see someone get a flu shot in the morning and take a homeopathic remedy for a cold in the evening without any sense of contradiction. How do these beliefs—one grounded in science, the other far outside it—coexist so easily in the same mind?

It helps to think of the mind as an ecosystem of ideas, where different beliefs occupy their own niches, growing and evolving based on their environment. Much like species in nature, these ideas don’t necessarily need to compete directly; they can thrive in balance as long as their roles remain distinct. Homeopathy and science, for example, perform different functions for many people—science for serious illness, homeopathy for minor, everyday ailments. As long as these beliefs serve separate purposes, they don’t need to confront one another.

Homeopathy itself has a curious history. Developed by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th century, it’s based on the idea that “like cures like”—a substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person can cure those same symptoms when diluted. The dilutions are often so extreme that there’s nothing left of the original substance, yet homeopathy thrives in this mental ecosystem. From a scientific standpoint, this doesn’t make much sense. And yet, the belief persists, much like a species in an ecosystem that’s adapted to a specific niche where it faces little direct competition.

Part of the reason lies in history. In the 18th and 19th centuries, many medical treatments were as harmful as the diseases they aimed to cure. Bloodletting and purging, for instance, often caused more damage than the illness itself. In that context, homeopathy was appealing because it didn’t make things worse. When the alternatives are dangerous, doing nothing feels like a cure. This created a space in which homeopathy could thrive, much like a species in an ecosystem finding fertile ground where others can’t survive.

But homeopathy also offered something that’s still appealing today: attention and care. Homeopaths spend time with their patients, listening not just to physical symptoms but also to emotional states. That kind of care builds trust, and in an ecosystem where emotional well-being is crucial, this trust allows homeopathy to maintain its place—even without scientific backing. The belief is reinforced not because it stands up to empirical scrutiny, but because it fulfills a need that science often overlooks.

What’s especially interesting is how people who fully trust modern medicine still rely on homeopathy for certain things. It’s as if these beliefs occupy different corners of the mind’s ecosystem, each thriving in its own niche. Science is called upon for serious conditions that need antibiotics or surgery, while homeopathy is trusted for minor ailments like colds or headaches. These beliefs remain in balance, coexisting without conflict because they operate in separate realms.

But like any ecosystem, the mind’s landscape is subject to change. New ideas or experiences can disrupt the balance, forcing previously harmonious beliefs into competition. Take my wife, for example. For years, homeopathy and evidence-based medicine coexisted peacefully in her mind. Homeopathy handled minor issues, like colds or headaches, while science took care of more serious concerns. They occupied different niches, never needing to confront one another.

Then something shifted. She began to grow skeptical of osteopathy, another alternative treatment that seemed less grounded in reason. This skepticism acted like a disturbance in the ecosystem, a new environmental pressure. Once she started questioning osteopathy, that skepticism began to spread to her views on homeopathy. The mental equilibrium that had kept homeopathy and science in separate niches was now unsettled.

Suddenly, homeopathy and evidence-based medicine found themselves in direct competition. Where once they had existed peacefully in their own domains, they were now vying for dominance in the same cognitive space. New evidence—studies debunking homeopathy—began to strengthen her trust in science, much like a species better adapted to changing conditions. Homeopathy, unable to compete with the more robust framework of evidence-based medicine, started to wither and decline in her mental ecosystem.

These kinds of shifts don’t happen immediately. Just like ecosystems in nature, cognitive ecosystems don’t change overnight. But when both opportunity and motivation come together—the opportunity being new information, and the motivation being a reason to critically reassess long-held beliefs—the mental landscape starts to evolve. In my wife’s case, the growing discomfort with alternative treatments provided the motivation, and the studies she encountered provided the opportunity. Together, they tipped the balance.

The two axes of opportunity and motivation can explain why some mental ecosystems remain stable while others evolve. In environments where homeopathy is accepted as part of mainstream culture, there’s often little opportunity for the belief to be challenged. Even when new information presents itself, if the emotional or cultural ties to the belief are strong enough, there may be little motivation to change. But when both opportunity and motivation are high, the ecosystem shifts, and conflicting beliefs may begin to compete.

What’s most interesting is how comfortable we are living with these mental ecosystems, rarely noticing the contradictions between different beliefs. We’re not irrational; we’re simply operating within a cognitive system that maintains balance until something disrupts it. As long as these conflicting ideas occupy different niches and aren’t forced to confront one another, they can coexist without tension—much like species in a balanced ecosystem.

But when new information, personal reflection, or outside influence forces these ideas to collide, the mental ecosystem must adapt. The beliefs either evolve, like species adapting to new environmental pressures, or they die off, replaced by more resilient, better-fitting ideas.
