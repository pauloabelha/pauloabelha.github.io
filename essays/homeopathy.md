# Homeopathy and Other Species

It’s strange how two completely contradictory beliefs can coexist in the same mind without causing any friction. Think of someone who trusts modern medicine enough to get their flu shot in the morning, but later in the day reaches for a homeopathic remedy when they feel a cold coming on. There’s no internal conflict, no cognitive dissonance—just two beliefs, side by side, that never seem to confront one another. How do these opposing beliefs manage to live together so peacefully?

The answer lies in how the mind operates. Rather than functioning like a logical machine, constantly filtering out contradictions, it’s more like an ecosystem—a landscape where beliefs, like species, occupy different niches. Some ideas are strong and well-adapted to a variety of contexts, while others are fragile, relying on very specific conditions to survive. In this cognitive ecosystem, beliefs don’t always need to compete directly. Homeopathy and science, for instance, can coexist because they’re called upon in different contexts—homeopathy for minor ailments, science for serious health concerns. As long as these beliefs stay in their respective corners, there’s no need for confrontation.

But in any ecosystem, this balance can shift when the environment changes. When niches collide or the conditions that protected weaker species disappear, competition begins. Strong ideas thrive because they can adapt and grow stronger under scrutiny. Fragile ideas, though malleable, often survive by bending around challenges—but this flexibility is a sign of their underlying weakness. Like species that rely on narrow, protected environments, these ideas can collapse if their shelter is removed.

Homeopathy is a prime example of a fragile idea that has managed to survive by finding a protected niche. Scientifically, it doesn’t hold up. The core principle, introduced by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th century, is that “like cures like”—meaning that a substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person can cure those same symptoms when highly diluted. But these dilutions are so extreme that there’s no trace of the original substance left, making the remedy no different from water or sugar pills. And yet, despite the lack of scientific evidence, homeopathy persists. How can that be?

Part of the answer lies in the context in which homeopathy emerged. In the 18th and 19th centuries, mainstream medical treatments like bloodletting and purging were not just ineffective, but often dangerous. In this environment, homeopathy found its niche. It didn’t harm people—often, it didn’t do much at all—but when doing nothing was better than the alternatives, homeopathy thrived. It was a gentler option in a brutal medical landscape, and its appeal grew not because it was effective, but because it avoided harm.

But survival in the cognitive ecosystem isn’t just about avoiding harm. Homeopathy also fills an emotional role, and this is what gives it its staying power. Homeopaths spend significant time with their patients, listening to their symptoms and emotional concerns. This personal attention builds trust in a way that modern medicine, often more clinical and detached, doesn’t always achieve. Patients feel heard, understood, and cared for—and that feeling is powerful. In this way, homeopathy occupies a well-protected niche in the mind’s ecosystem, not because of its scientific basis, but because of the emotional fulfillment it provides.

This emotional attachment acts as a kind of cognitive shelter, protecting the belief from the scrutiny it would otherwise face. People hold on to fragile beliefs like homeopathy because they offer more than just a remedy for physical ailments—they provide comfort, control, and a sense of alignment with broader worldviews, like the preference for natural or holistic treatments. These psychological and emotional needs insulate the belief from the cognitive competition that might otherwise crowd it out.

But emotional attachment isn’t the only force at play. Cultural reinforcement also acts as a protective barrier for weak ideas. In certain social circles, alternative treatments like homeopathy aren’t just health choices—they’re part of a larger identity. Using homeopathy isn’t just about avoiding pharmaceuticals; it’s about embracing a lifestyle that values natural remedies and rejects mainstream medical practices. This cultural validation creates an artificial shelter in the cognitive ecosystem, protecting fragile beliefs from direct confrontation with stronger, evidence-based ideas. As long as these cultural structures hold, the belief survives in its niche, unchallenged.

This dynamic worked for years in my own life. My wife trusted homeopathy for minor ailments like colds and headaches, while relying on evidence-based medicine for more serious health concerns. The two beliefs coexisted peacefully in her mind, each occupying a different role in her cognitive ecosystem. Homeopathy handled the day-to-day discomforts, while science was reserved for critical, serious issues. They existed in separate niches and never had to confront one another directly.

But something eventually changed. My wife began to grow skeptical of osteopathy, another alternative treatment she had once relied on. At first, this skepticism was isolated—osteopathy started to feel less grounded in reason, particularly when some of its methods seemed invasive or unfounded. But this initial doubt acted like the removal of an environmental barrier in her cognitive ecosystem. By questioning osteopathy, she opened a door that allowed her previously isolated beliefs to collide. The cognitive niches where homeopathy had been safely sheltered from scrutiny suddenly merged with the larger ecosystem of evidence-based medicine.

Once these barriers were removed, cognitive competition began. The robust structure of evidence-based medicine, grounded in scientific data, began to take up more space in her mind, crowding out the fragile, easily varied beliefs like homeopathy. What had once been a well-protected niche for homeopathy was now exposed to new pressures, and homeopathy, unable to compete with the more resilient framework of science, began to fade. It didn’t collapse immediately, but like a species that loses its habitat, it gradually weakened and declined.

This process illustrates a key aspect of how beliefs evolve. When protected by emotional attachment and cultural support, fragile beliefs can survive for long periods without facing serious competition. But when the conditions that shelter them are removed, they become vulnerable. In my wife’s case, her growing skepticism of osteopathy acted like an environmental shift—it removed the barriers that had kept her beliefs isolated, forcing them to compete. And as her cognitive ecosystem adapted to the new pressures, only the most robust beliefs survived.

But not all weak beliefs face such competition. Many survive because they continue to be protected by emotional or cultural reinforcement, thriving in isolated cognitive niches where they’re rarely exposed to direct challenge. For many people, beliefs like homeopathy persist not because they are the strongest or most logical, but because they fulfill deeper psychological needs. In these cases, the mind doesn’t need the belief to be scientifically sound—it just needs it to feel right. As long as the emotional and cultural shelter remains intact, the belief can survive indefinitely.

In the end, the mind’s ecosystem is constantly shifting. Beliefs evolve, compete, and sometimes wither, but the ideas that survive aren’t always the ones that are true—they’re the ones best adapted to their niches. Some ideas thrive by growing stronger when challenged, incorporating new evidence, and becoming more robust. Others, like homeopathy, survive because they’re sheltered by emotional attachment and cultural validation. But as we’ve seen, that shelter can only last so long. In time, the cognitive ecosystem will inevitably change, and only the most robust ideas will continue to thrive.
