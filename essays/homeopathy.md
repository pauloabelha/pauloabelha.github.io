# Homeopathy, allodoxia

I’ve often wondered how people can believe in homeopathy while also trusting modern medicine. You’ll see someone get a flu shot in the morning and take a homeopathic remedy for a cold in the evening without any sense of contradiction. How do these beliefs—one grounded in science, the other far outside it—coexist so easily in the same mind?

The answer, I think, lies in how our minds work more like ecosystems of ideas than neatly divided silos. In an ecosystem, different species can thrive in harmony, each playing a unique role, even if they seem at odds. Similarly, our beliefs about science and homeopathy occupy different niches in our mental ecosystem. They don’t need to compete directly because they serve different purposes: science for serious illness, homeopathy for minor, everyday ailments. They exist in balance until something disrupts that equilibrium.

Homeopathy itself is an interesting case. Developed by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th century, it’s based on the idea that “like cures like”—a substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person can cure those same symptoms when diluted. The dilutions are taken to such extremes that there’s often nothing left of the original substance, yet it’s believed to become more powerful. From a scientific perspective, this doesn’t add up, and yet homeopathy continues to be widely used.

Part of the reason is historical. In the 18th and 19th centuries, many medical treatments were as harmful as the diseases they aimed to cure. Bloodletting and purging were common, often causing more damage than the illness itself. In that context, homeopathy had a distinct advantage—it didn’t make things worse. When the alternative is dangerous, doing nothing can feel like doing something.

But homeopathy didn’t just survive because it avoided harm. It also offered something that’s still appealing today: attention and care. Homeopaths spend time with their patients, listening not just to their physical symptoms but to their emotional states as well. That kind of personal care can’t be measured in clinical trials, but it builds trust in the treatment. And in an ecosystem where emotional needs play a key role, that trust allows homeopathy to thrive, even without scientific backing.

What’s especially interesting is how people who believe in science still rely on homeopathy for certain things. It’s as if they’ve partitioned their mental ecosystem, allowing homeopathy to coexist peacefully alongside science, each occupying its own niche. Science is trusted for serious conditions—things that need antibiotics or surgery. But for minor ailments—colds, headaches, or stress—homeopathy fills a different role. In this way, the two belief systems never really clash because they’re kept in separate parts of the ecosystem, performing different functions.

But mental ecosystems are not static. They evolve. New ideas or experiences can disrupt the balance. Take my wife, for example. She used homeopathy for years. It worked for her, or at least it seemed to, especially for small things like colds and headaches. In her mental ecosystem, homeopathy occupied a safe, comfortable niche—it didn’t conflict with her trust in science because it handled different things.

But then something shifted. She started getting skeptical about another alternative treatment: osteopathy. It felt vague to her, not grounded in reason. That initial skepticism was like an invasive species, disrupting the balance of her belief system. Once she questioned one alternative treatment, the seeds of doubt spread to others. She started researching homeopathy more deeply, and over time, she encountered studies that debunked it—studies showing it was no more effective than a placebo. Slowly, her belief in homeopathy began to wither. What had once thrived in her mental ecosystem began to die off as new information reshaped the environment.

This disruption wasn’t immediate. Ecosystems don’t change overnight. But over time, as new information took root, her mental environment evolved. The role homeopathy once played was slowly replaced by a more critical, evidence-based approach.

In her case, the two axes of this mental shift were opportunity and motivation. The opportunity came when new information presented itself—when she encountered credible studies that challenged her previous assumptions. But opportunity alone isn’t enough. The real shift happened because she also had the motivation to reevaluate her beliefs. That motivation came from her growing discomfort with other alternative treatments. When both opportunity and motivation aligned, the ecosystem of her beliefs evolved.

These two axes—opportunity and motivation—can explain why cognitive ecosystems remain stable for some people but evolve in others. Where there’s low opportunity to confront contradictory beliefs, such as in environments where homeopathy is integrated into mainstream healthcare, beliefs can coexist for a long time without conflict. Even when there is opportunity, the motivation to challenge those beliefs may be absent if they’re tied to deep emotional or cultural roots.

However, when both opportunity and motivation are high, as in my wife’s case, the mind’s ecosystem can shift. Beliefs that once coexisted peacefully may start to compete, and eventually, one may fade as the other grows stronger.

This happens more often than we realize. Cognitive ecosystems, like natural ones, can be remarkably resilient, but they’re also vulnerable to disruption. As long as different beliefs occupy different roles and aren’t forced to confront one another, the ecosystem stays balanced. But when something forces those ideas into direct competition—new evidence, a contradictory experience—the balance can shift, and the ecosystem evolves.

What I find most intriguing isn’t just that people can hold conflicting beliefs, but that they often don’t even notice the contradiction. Our mental ecosystems are so well-tuned to maintaining harmony that we rarely experience the tension between opposing ideas. It’s not that people are being irrational; it’s that their beliefs occupy different spaces, perform different roles, and therefore don’t compete—until they have to
