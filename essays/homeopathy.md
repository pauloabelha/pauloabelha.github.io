# Homeopathy and Other Species

Contradictions fascinate me. We spot them all around us: in systems, institutions, and people. They settle in quietly, weaving themselves into the stories we live by. Left alone, they can last a lifetime. And trying to expose them rarely works — as I learned when a friend’s belief in homeopathy quietly collapsed.

I used to think evidence could unravel a contradiction — that it was like a knot waiting for reason to untangle it. This changed when I saw my friend let go of her belief; on her own, not because someone argued her out of it. For all I know, none of our brief discussions changed much of her opinion.

She’d always supported science. She trusted research, followed evidence, defended vaccines. And yet, for years, she also believed in homeopathy — despite the broad scientific consensus against it.

In many cultures, homeopathy doesn’t _feel_ unscientific. It’s folded into formal medical systems, sometimes even recommended alongside scientific treatment. That may be why many people feel no internal conflict. Some see it not as pseudoscience, but as a knowledge system neglected by mainstream research. That belief can persist even in the face of evidence.

I brought it up a few times — how it defies science, how most serious institutions now treat it as pseudoscience. It made little difference. She didn’t argue, but she closed off — as if the conversation brushed against something she needed to keep balanced.

The truth is, I had been thinking about beliefs too narrowly — as things either true or false, evidence-based or not, and assumed that those which didn’t measure up would naturally fall away. I saw emotion as an enhancer or a blocker, nothing more. What I hadn’t considered was that contradictions can survive — not despite being exposed, but because minds are structured to let them survive. That thought led me to think about the mind as an ecosystem.

In this mental ecosystem, ideas behave like species. Some thrive in open air — resilient, competing, spreading across the mind. Others survive only in the shade, nestled near stronger ideas or drawing quiet support from emotion. Fragile beliefs don’t stand alone. They persist by leaning on sturdier ones, or by settling into pockets of warmth and protection. What endures isn’t always what’s strongest, but what finds a place.

But beliefs don’t merely coexist — they cluster. They form symbiotic networks, like plants sharing root systems or fungal webs beneath a forest floor. One belief shelters another, or supplies it with nutrients — emotional, cultural, narrative. A weak idea may persist not by its own strength, but by its connections. In this way, minds don’t just host ideas; they cultivate interdependent ecologies. Beliefs co-evolve. Some even act parasitically, drawing energy from others without offering much in return. A conspiracy theory, for instance, might leech credibility from legitimate doubt without supplying coherence of its own. Others form mutualisms — reinforcing each other so tightly that neither would survive alone.

Homeopathy is just one such species, adapted to the shaded corners of a mind that also harbors many scientific ones. Astrology grows nearby. Despite lacking scientific foundation, it fulfills other roles — emotional patterning, symbolic coherence, a sense of rhythm in disorder. It doesn’t compete with science directly. It survives by feeding a different part of the psyche.

Their persistence points to something deeper. These beliefs are not purely intellectual. They’re social, cultural, emotional. Rejecting homeopathy, for some, might feel like turning away from a shared past. The belief isn’t a lone tree in the clearing. It’s part of a grove — reinforced by the soil and the shade around it.

Not all minds offer the same terrain. Some people develop what you might call cognitive biodiversity early on — a dense tangle of interlocking ideas. I have a friend who, by age eight, was obsessed with dinosaurs and the scientific concepts surrounding them. He told me how, even then, he felt something odd about what the priest was preaching in Sunday church. His early grasp of evolution and deep time left little room for certain religious stories. Such concepts didn’t even get the chance to germinate.

His mind wasn’t cleared of contradiction by force. It was filled with something else — geology, biology, astronomy — each reinforcing the others. In that thicket, unsupported ideas had nowhere to land. There was no battle — just no room. Other young minds might find a way to integrate religious teachings, but his had just the right population and balance to reject it. The preached concepts could not take root in that ecosystem.

Now contrast this with a mind that grows up in sparse mental surroundings. In open, unchallenged terrain, unvetted beliefs spread easily. There’s space, and little resistance. Complexity isn’t ornamental. It’s structural defense.

This leads to something crucial. Rationality doesn’t dismantle beliefs through logic alone. It’s not about syllogisms. It’s about what fits. A mind full of interconnected ideas will find it harder to absorb weaker ones. There are too many points of conflict. The weak belief has nowhere to hide.

Thinking about young minds again: early exposure to challenges that call for the creation of complex ecosystems doesn’t just train the mind. It alters the climate.

The shift in my friend's mind didn’t start with homeopathy. It began nearby — with osteopathy. She came across medical warnings about its risks to babies and children, including reports of harm. Like many alternative practices, osteopathy had been folded into a space of nurture — tied to care, softness, and the emotional landscape of motherhood. That’s where its shelter lived. But the possibility of harm pierced that space. It was too stark, too close. The emotional canopy that had long insulated those beliefs began to thin.

With less cover, criticism could finally take hold. When she later read that osteopathy is widely regarded as a pseudoscience, the label didn’t bounce off. It stuck. Scientific species, long kept at a distance, moved into terrain that had once excluded them. Coexistence gave way to conflict. She read everything — a private, week-long reckoning. By the end, homeopathy made no sense. It didn’t collapse from argument. It lost its shelter.

Contradictions are everywhere. But conflict only matters when species meet. Minds don’t just integrate — they partition. They let contradictions take root — so long as the terrain stays undisturbed.
