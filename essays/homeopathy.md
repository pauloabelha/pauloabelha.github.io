# Homeopathy and Other Species

This isn’t an essay about whether homeopathy is scientifically valid. I’m not here to convince anyone to give it up, nor am I interested in catering to those who’ve already decided it’s pseudoscience. Those debates, while maybe useful to some, often don’t lead anywhere meaningful. So, if this isn’t about whether homeopathy works or not, what is it about? It’s about how homeopathy, like astrology, osteopathy, and countless other beliefs, thrives in the complicated landscape of our minds—where logic and emotion don’t always fight for dominance, but rather find ways to coexist.

During the pandemic, I came across people who were strong believers in science—people who took public health guidelines seriously, supported vaccination, trusted medical experts—and yet, they also swore by homeopathy. On one hand, they put their faith in institutions that dismiss homeopathy as pseudoscience. On the other hand, they embraced it. This raised a question: How can people hold two beliefs that seem so contradictory without any sense of conflict? How can they trust science with one hand and then ignore it with the other?

Maybe we’re approaching belief too narrowly. We tend to assume that if a belief doesn’t align with evidence, it should be discarded. But what if belief isn’t about logic alone? What if we thought of the mind not as a rational machine, but as an ecosystem? In this ecosystem, ideas act like species. Some are strong and thrive in direct competition, while others are fragile and survive by finding protected spaces. They don’t all have to be logical; they just have to meet a need or fill a niche.

Take homeopathy. The basic idea—"like cures like"—was introduced over 200 years ago by Samuel Hahnemann. The notion that a substance causing symptoms can cure those same symptoms in a diluted form has no scientific basis. In fact, many homeopathic remedies are diluted so much that no molecules of the original substance are left. Yet, people continue to believe in it. Why? Because homeopathy offers something science often doesn’t: time, attention, and care.

When you see a homeopath, it’s not just about the remedy. It’s about someone sitting with you, listening carefully, and looking beyond your symptoms to understand your whole self. That creates trust, and trust is powerful. Even if the belief itself is fragile, trust can shield it from scrutiny. It allows that belief to persist, surviving in a sheltered space, safe from the harsher light of evidence.

What’s fascinating is how people hold onto these fragile beliefs while still trusting in science. In many minds, science dominates because it’s built on evidence, it adapts, it faces competition head-on. But that doesn’t mean it pushes out everything else. Homeopathy, for instance, survives because it isn’t competing directly with science in these people’s minds. It occupies a different space—a sheltered niche, like a fragile species thriving in a valley, far from the competition of open fields.

The same goes for astrology. Despite the fact that science offers no support for the idea that the stars or planets influence our daily lives, millions of people still consult their horoscopes. Astrology, like homeopathy, doesn’t survive because it can stand up to scientific rigor. It survives because it meets emotional needs, offering comfort and a sense of control that science doesn’t always provide.

These beliefs endure because they offer something deeper than intellectual satisfaction. For many, homeopathy isn’t just a medical practice; it’s part of a larger worldview. To reject it would mean rejecting a piece of themselves, a thread woven into their identity or cultural heritage. Beliefs like these aren’t just personal—they’re reinforced by the community, making them even more resilient, like a fragile species thriving in a well-managed habitat.

But here’s the thing—not everyone’s mind is equally open to fragile beliefs. Some people grow up surrounded by a rich variety of ideas, and that diversity creates a kind of resilience against fragile notions. I had a friend who, by the age of eight, was fascinated by dinosaurs. His deep curiosity about the earth’s ancient past and the science of evolution made him skeptical of the religious teachings he encountered in church. It wasn’t that anyone told him to reject those ideas. It’s just that his mind, filled with scientific knowledge, didn’t have the space for them. In his cognitive ecosystem, there was no room for creationist ideas because they didn’t fit alongside his understanding of dinosaurs and the vastness of time.

What happened in his mind was more than just a single belief taking root. It was the cumulative effect of many ideas reinforcing each other. His understanding of dinosaurs led to an understanding of evolution, which connected to his knowledge of biology, geology, and beyond. It wasn’t one belief versus another. It was a whole ecosystem of thoughts, each idea supporting and interacting with the others, making his mind a diverse and rich landscape. In a mind like that, fragile ideas have a hard time finding a place to grow.

Contrast that with someone who hasn’t had the same exposure to a wide range of ideas. In a simpler mental ecosystem, without the variety of competing beliefs, fragile ideas—those rooted more in emotion than in evidence—can grow more easily. Without the challenge of stronger, well-supported beliefs, fragile ones can take hold and flourish.

This is how exposure to many different ideas can protect a mind from fragility. A mind filled with diverse, evidence-based thoughts becomes like a varied ecosystem, where competing ideas coexist and reinforce one another. The more diversity in the ecosystem, the harder it is for any single fragile belief to dominate. Early exposure to rational, evidence-based ideas acts like a defense, making it difficult for beliefs that lack that grounding to gain a foothold.

Of course, not everyone’s beliefs are shaped by this kind of early diversity. Some beliefs, like homeopathy or astrology, are deeply entrenched, protected not by logic, but by emotional or cultural ties. I saw this up close. My wife once believed in homeopathy. Not half-heartedly, but with real conviction. And no amount of debate or scientific evidence would’ve changed her mind. In fact, the more we argue, the more entrenched these beliefs can become. Like a fragile species in a well-protected valley, homeopathy in her mind wasn’t competing with science directly—it was safe in its emotional niche.

But over time, something interesting happened. My wife started to question another alternative practice she believed in—osteopathy. And with that questioning, the emotional walls protecting homeopathy began to crumble. It wasn’t that I convinced her or anyone else did. It was an internal shift, a small doubt that led her to reexamine what she believed. Once she let herself question one fragile belief, the others couldn’t hide from scrutiny anymore.

This is how fragile beliefs change, not from the outside but from within. External arguments, no matter how logical, are like foreign species trying to invade a well-defended ecosystem. They rarely succeed. Real change happens when the mind itself becomes ready to allow competition. Without that internal motivation, fragile beliefs can survive indefinitely, protected by emotional or cultural barriers.

But once those barriers weaken, the belief is forced to compete. And when fragile ideas are exposed to competition with stronger, more robust ones, they often can’t survive. My wife’s belief in homeopathy eventually faded, not because of external logic, but because the emotional shelter that had been protecting it slowly eroded.

This slow erosion tells us something important about how beliefs survive or die. Fragile beliefs can persist for a long time if they’re protected—by emotion, by identity, or by cultural ties. But when those protections weaken, when the mind opens itself up to scrutiny, fragile ideas often fall apart. That doesn’t mean every surviving idea is true or logical. In the ecosystem of the mind, survival isn’t always about truth. It’s about how well an idea fits into the landscape. Some beliefs, like science, grow stronger when challenged. Others, like homeopathy, survive not because they’re logical, but because they fulfill a need.

In the end, the beliefs that endure are the ones best adapted to the niches they inhabit. Minds, like ecosystems, change. Some ideas thrive under pressure. Others survive in sheltered spaces. But over time, only the most robust ideas—the ones that can adapt, that can face competition—are the ones that truly thrive.
