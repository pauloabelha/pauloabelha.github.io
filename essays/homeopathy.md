# Homeopathy and Other Species

This isn’t an essay about whether homeopathy works. I’m not here to persuade anyone to abandon it, nor am I interested in affirming the beliefs of those who see it as pseudoscience. That debate, while it can have its place, feels like a side track—one that mostly misses the point. So what is this essay about? It’s about how homeopathy, like astrology, osteopathy, and other beliefs, exists in the rich, varied ecosystem of our minds—an ecosystem where logic and belief don’t always compete, but sometimes coexist in strange harmony.

During the pandemic, I came across people who were firm believers in science—people who trusted in the importance of vaccines, followed public health guidelines, and respected institutions like the CDC and WHO. But some of these same people also swore by homeopathy. Here’s where the puzzle starts: how do they hold both ideas—trusting scientific institutions that reject homeopathy as pseudoscience, while also putting faith in homeopathy—without a sense of contradiction?

Maybe we’ve been thinking about beliefs too narrowly. We tend to assume that beliefs are either true or false, aligned with evidence or not, and those that don’t measure up should fall away. But that view ignores the complexity of how we actually think. What if, instead of treating the mind as a strict rational machine, we imagined it as a kind of ecosystem? In this ecosystem, ideas behave like species. Some are strong, resilient, and thrive in direct competition. Others are more fragile, finding their own protected spaces where they survive without having to face the pressure of logic or evidence.

Take homeopathy. Its basic principle—"like cures like"—was proposed by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 1700s. The idea is that substances that produce symptoms in a healthy person can cure those same symptoms when given in tiny, often absurdly diluted doses. From a scientific perspective, this doesn’t hold up. There’s no empirical mechanism for how it could work—especially when some dilutions leave no trace of the original substance. But despite that, people believe in it. Why? Because homeopathy provides something that science often doesn’t: time, attention, and care.

When you visit a homeopath, it’s not just about the remedy. It’s about the experience of someone listening to you, understanding your whole self, not just your symptoms. That creates trust, and trust is powerful. Even if the belief itself is fragile under scrutiny, that trust forms a kind of protective barrier. It allows homeopathy to persist in an emotional niche, safe from the harsh, unfiltered light of scientific skepticism.

What’s really interesting is that these fragile beliefs don’t feel like contradictions to those who hold them. In many minds, science dominates because it’s based on evidence, it’s adaptive, and it faces competition head-on. But this dominance doesn’t crowd out other ideas. Homeopathy, for instance, survives because it isn’t in direct competition with science in these minds. It occupies its own niche—like a species thriving in a remote valley, far from the predators of the open plains.

And this doesn’t only apply to homeopathy. Take astrology. Despite having no scientific support for the idea that the positions of the stars or planets affect our daily lives, millions still check their horoscopes. Astrology thrives, not because it can stand up to scientific scrutiny, but because it satisfies deeper emotional needs. It offers comfort, a sense of control, and sometimes even a cosmic narrative that science doesn’t provide. In these niches, fragile beliefs aren’t directly competing with the stronger species of scientific ideas—they exist on their own terms.

Beliefs like homeopathy and astrology endure because they offer something beyond intellectual satisfaction. They connect to identity, culture, and a sense of personal meaning. To reject homeopathy, for example, might feel like rejecting a piece of yourself, or a bond you’ve built with a community. In this way, the belief isn’t just personal; it’s socially reinforced, like a species protected by the barriers of a carefully managed habitat.

But not everyone’s mental ecosystem is equally open to fragile beliefs. Some people develop a kind of cognitive biodiversity early on, filling their minds with diverse, strong, interwoven ideas that don’t leave much room for fragile species. I have a friend who, by the age of eight, was fascinated by dinosaurs. His understanding of ancient life and the concept of deep time naturally led to a skepticism of the religious teachings he encountered in church. His mind was already filled with scientific knowledge, and there simply wasn’t space for the belief that the Earth was only a few thousand years old. It couldn’t take root.

In his case, it wasn’t just one belief replacing another. His mind was like a richly populated ecosystem, where ideas about biology, evolution, and geology all interacted and reinforced each other. When you have that kind of complexity and interconnection, fragile ideas have a hard time establishing themselves. They’re crowded out by stronger, well-supported beliefs that have grown over time.

Contrast that with someone who grows up with less exposure to diverse ideas. In a simpler cognitive ecosystem, fragile beliefs can more easily take root and grow. Without the challenge of competing ideas, they can thrive, filling empty spaces that might otherwise be occupied by stronger, more evidence-based thinking.

This shows how early exposure to a range of ideas can protect the mind from fragility. A well-developed mental ecosystem, rich in diversity, becomes resilient to the intrusion of fragile beliefs. Early rational ideas, grounded in evidence, act like guardians, crowding out beliefs that might otherwise find a foothold.

That’s not to say that everyone’s beliefs develop this way. For many people, beliefs like homeopathy or astrology are deeply entrenched, protected by emotional and cultural ties rather than by logic. My wife once believed in homeopathy. Not casually, but with quiet conviction. No amount of logical argument or scientific evidence would have changed her mind—at least not directly. In fact, trying to convince her otherwise might have only reinforced her attachment, like a fragile species growing more dependent on its sheltered valley.

But over time, something interesting happened. She began to question osteopathy, another alternative practice she had believed in. That doubt weakened the emotional barriers protecting homeopathy. It wasn’t because of external pressure, but an internal shift—a small crack in the protective wall. Once she allowed herself to question one belief, the others had no place to hide. Her own mind had started to allow competition, and when fragile beliefs face competition with stronger, more rational ideas, they often can’t survive.

This is how fragile beliefs change—not through external confrontation, but through internal motivation. No matter how well-reasoned an outside argument may be, it’s like a foreign species trying to invade a well-defended ecosystem. Real change happens when the mind itself begins to open up, allowing new ideas to challenge the old ones.

When that internal shift occurs, beliefs are forced to compete. And in most cases, fragile beliefs, when exposed to direct competition with more robust ideas, don’t hold up. My wife’s belief in homeopathy eventually faded, not because anyone convinced her, but because the emotional shelter that had protected it crumbled from within.

This slow erosion reveals something crucial about how ideas survive or die. Fragile beliefs can persist for a long time when they’re protected by emotional attachment, cultural identity, or social validation. But once those protections weaken, and the mind begins to allow scrutiny, they often fall apart. It’s not always about truth—survival in the mental ecosystem depends on how well an idea fits into the overall landscape of your thoughts.

In the end, beliefs that endure are those that can adapt and grow stronger when challenged. Minds, like ecosystems, change. Some ideas thrive through competition, while others survive by finding shelter. But over time, only the most resilient ideas—the ones that can face scrutiny and adapt—are the ones that continue to thrive.
