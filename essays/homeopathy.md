# Homeopathy, allodoxia

How is it that two completely contradictory beliefs can coexist in the same mind without causing friction? Think of the person who gets a flu shot in the morning, trusting in science and vaccines, and later, when faced with a cold, reaches for a homeopathic remedy. It seems like there should be an internal conflict brewing, but there’s none. How do beliefs that sit on opposite ends of the scientific spectrum manage to live together so peacefully?

The mind, it turns out, doesn’t operate like a logical machine that weeds out falsehoods. Instead, it’s more like an ecosystem, where different ideas and beliefs—like species—occupy distinct niches. Some beliefs, like homeopathy, persist because they fill certain roles in this mental landscape, thriving in emotional or cultural pockets, while stronger, evidence-based ideas handle more critical functions. It’s not about having one “right” belief, but rather about the mind finding room for multiple ideas to coexist.

Take homeopathy. Scientifically, it doesn’t make much sense. The principle of “like cures like”—the idea that a substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person can cure the same symptoms when highly diluted—is hard to reconcile with modern biology. These dilutions are so extreme that not even a trace of the original substance remains, which means there’s no measurable action the remedy could perform. Yet, homeopathy persists, even among people who fully trust science in other aspects of their health. How can that be?

To understand this, we need to look at the history of homeopathy. It emerged in the late 18th century, at a time when mainstream medical treatments were often more dangerous than the diseases themselves. Practices like bloodletting and purging were common, and they frequently harmed patients. Homeopathy, by offering a gentler, non-invasive alternative, found its niche. It didn’t actively harm people—often, it didn’t do much at all—but that was the point. People were desperate for treatments that didn’t make them feel worse, and simply doing nothing harmful felt like a relief. In that environment, homeopathy thrived.

But it wasn’t just the avoidance of harm that allowed homeopathy to persist. It also provided something that modern medicine often overlooked: emotional care. Homeopaths would spend considerable time with their patients, listening not only to their physical symptoms but also to their personal and emotional concerns. This personalized attention built trust in a way that scientific medicine, which could sometimes feel detached or impersonal, didn’t. And that trust is powerful. In the cognitive ecosystem, trust and emotional fulfillment create a kind of sheltered niche where ideas can thrive—even when those ideas don’t hold up under rigorous scrutiny.

Interestingly, the mind’s ecosystem doesn’t just favor the strong, evidence-based beliefs. Weaker beliefs—like homeopathy or astrology—persist because they serve emotional and cultural needs. These beliefs are fragile when exposed to direct scrutiny, but they survive because they don’t often face it. They exist in protected cognitive niches, much like a species that thrives in a sheltered habitat. These ideas are supported not by evidence but by emotional attachment and social reinforcement. People hold onto them fondly because they meet psychological needs for meaning, comfort, or identity. In some environments, being emotionally valuable is more than enough for a belief to survive.

But when it comes to ideas that can withstand cognitive pressure, the strongest ones tend to be those that are hard to vary. Certain beliefs are resilient because they can’t easily be modified to fit changing circumstances—they hold their ground because they are rooted in evidence that doesn’t shift based on emotional need or personal preference. Scientific ideas, for instance, are built on frameworks that require them to remain coherent and consistent under intense scrutiny. If you tried to alter them to accommodate every new piece of evidence without maintaining their core structure, they would collapse.

Beliefs like homeopathy, on the other hand, are easy to vary. When challenged, they often get reinterpreted or adjusted to fit the situation, but this flexibility is a sign of their weakness. They can be endlessly modified without losing their hold, but that malleability comes at the cost of rigor. In a sense, they lack the hard constraints that keep stronger ideas grounded. It’s like having a species that can only survive in an isolated environment—one that needs constant shelter from the wider ecosystem to thrive.

What’s particularly fascinating is how people who hold a broad set of ideas tend to experience more competition among their beliefs. The more ideas you allow into your cognitive ecosystem, the more likely they are to compete for space. When someone only holds a few rigid beliefs, those beliefs might never face real pressure to change. But when you introduce multiple ideas, each trying to explain the world in different ways, the weaker ones can’t help but face the stronger ones head-on.

I’ve seen this process in my own life. For years, my wife trusted homeopathy for minor ailments like colds and headaches while relying on science for more serious health issues. The two beliefs existed peacefully, occupying separate roles in her cognitive ecosystem. But then something shifted. She began to grow skeptical of osteopathy, another alternative treatment she had once believed in. That skepticism started small, but it grew over time, and eventually, she began to question not just osteopathy but homeopathy as well.

Her doubts acted like an environmental disturbance in her cognitive ecosystem. Once she started questioning one belief, it created space for the others to compete. Evidence-based medicine, grounded in data and scientific research, began to crowd out the more fragile, easily varied beliefs like homeopathy. Just as a species that adapts well to new conditions begins to dominate in nature, the hard-to-vary structure of science took hold in her mind. Homeopathy, which had thrived in a sheltered niche for so long, couldn’t withstand the pressure and eventually faded.

This process didn’t happen overnight, of course. Cognitive ecosystems, like natural ones, evolve gradually. But when the conditions change—when both opportunity and motivation align—beliefs that were once held fondly but weakly begin to wither, replaced by those that are stronger, more coherent, and better suited to survive scrutiny. In her case, the growing discomfort with alternative treatments provided the motivation, and the evidence she encountered provided the opportunity. The result was a slow but inevitable shift toward stronger, harder-to-vary beliefs.

In the end, the mind is a lot like nature. Beliefs compete, adapt, and evolve, and the ones that survive aren’t necessarily the ones that give us the most comfort—they’re the ones that can withstand the pressure of scrutiny. Ideas, like species, thrive not because they’re the most familiar or emotionally satisfying, but because they’re the ones best adapted to reality.
