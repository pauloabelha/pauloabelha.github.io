# Homeopathy and Other Species

Contradictions fascinate me.
We spot them all around us — in systems, institutions, and people.
They settle in quietly, weaving themselves into the stories we live by.
Left alone, they can last a lifetime.
And trying to expose them rarely works — as I would come to learn when a close friend’s belief system collapsed.

I used to think evidence could unravel a contradiction — that it was like a knot waiting for reason to untangle it.
This changed when I saw something rare: a friend quietly letting go of her belief in homeopathy.
No one argued her out of it. For all I know, none of our brief discussions changed much of her opinion. It surprised me, but something deeper in her had begun to shift.

She’d always supported science. She trusted research, followed evidence, defended vaccines. And yet, for years, she also believed in homeopathy — despite the broad scientific consensus against it.

In many cultures, homeopathy doesn’t _feel_ unscientific. It’s folded into formal medical systems, sometimes even recommended alongside scientific treatment. That may be why many people feel no internal conflict. Some see it not as pseudoscience, but as a knowledge system neglected by mainstream research. That belief can persist even in the face of evidence. 

I brought it up a few times — how it defies science, how most serious institutions now treat it as pseudoscience. It made little difference. She didn’t argue, but she closed off — as if the conversation brushed against something she needed to keep balanced.

I had been thinking about beliefs too narrowly. Seeing them as probably true or false, supported by evidence or not — and that those which don’t measure up should naturally fall away. But that view oversimplifies how our minds actually work. What if, instead of imagining the mind as a belief machine, we saw it as a kind of ecosystem?

In this mental ecosystem, ideas behave like species: some are robust, thriving through direct competition, while others are delicate — surviving in sheltered niches, protected from the harsh scrutiny of logic or evidence.

When you visit a homeopath, it’s not just about the remedy. It’s about being listened to, being seen as a whole person rather than reduced to a set of symptoms. That experience creates trust — and trust is powerful. Even if the belief itself is fragile under scrutiny, the emotional connection forms a kind of protective barrier. Homeopathy survives in an emotional niche, shielded from the glare of scientific skepticism.

What’s striking is that for many who hold these beliefs, they don’t feel like contradictions. Science — based on evidence and competition of ideas — might dominate their worldview. But dominance doesn’t always lead to extinction. Homeopathy, for instance, survives not by competing with science, but by withdrawing from its arena — like a species thriving in a remote valley, far from the predators of the open plains.

This phenomenon isn’t unique to homeopathy. Take astrology. Despite lacking any scientific basis for the claim that celestial positions shape daily life, millions still check their horoscopes. Astrology endures not because it withstands critique, but because it fulfills emotional needs: comfort, narrative, a sense of meaning. It offers a story — one that science doesn’t always provide.

In this way, fragile beliefs like astrology and homeopathy aren’t necessarily in conflict with robust scientific ideas. They coexist — not on the same terrain, but in separate ecological niches, each serving a different function.

Their persistence points to something deeper. These beliefs offer more than intellectual satisfaction. They connect to identity, culture, and belonging. Rejecting homeopathy, for instance, might feel like rejecting a part of one’s community. The belief is not just personal — it’s socially sustained, like a species thriving in a carefully managed habitat.

However, not everyone’s mental ecosystem is equally receptive to fragile beliefs. Some people develop what might be called cognitive biodiversity early on — a mind rich with strong, diverse, interwoven ideas that leave little space for fragile species. I have a friend who, by the age of eight, was already fascinated by dinosaurs. His early grasp of biology, deep time, and evolution naturally led him to question the religious teachings he encountered at church. His mental ecosystem was already populated with scientific ideas, and there was simply no room for the belief that the Earth was only a few thousand years old. It couldn’t take root.

In his case, it wasn’t just one belief replacing another. His mind was a richly populated ecosystem, where concepts from geology, biology, and evolution interacted and reinforced each other. When you have that level of complexity and interconnection, fragile beliefs struggle to find a foothold. They’re crowded out by more resilient, evidence-based ideas that have evolved over time.

Now, contrast that with someone who grows up with less exposure to diverse ideas. In a simpler cognitive ecosystem, fragile beliefs can more easily take root and grow. Without the challenge of competing ideas, these beliefs can thrive, filling mental spaces that might otherwise be occupied by stronger, more rigorously tested thoughts.

This points to a crucial insight: early exposure to a wide range of ideas can create a mental ecosystem that is resilient to fragile beliefs. Rational, evidence-based thinking becomes like an established species, crowding out ideas that might otherwise flourish in an underdeveloped cognitive environment.

That’s not to say that all beliefs develop this way. For many, beliefs like homeopathy or astrology are deeply entrenched, protected more by emotional or cultural ties than by logic. My wife, for example, once believed in homeopathy. Not casually, but with deep conviction. No amount of logical argument or scientific evidence would have changed her mind—at least not directly. In fact, trying to convince her might have only strengthened her attachment, much like a fragile species becoming more dependent on its sheltered environment.

Over time, however, something changed. She began to question osteopathy, another alternative practice she had long trusted. That small crack in her belief system weakened the emotional barriers protecting homeopathy. Once she started to question one belief, others had nowhere to hide. Her mind began to allow competition, and fragile beliefs, when forced into competition with stronger, more rational ideas, often can’t survive.

This gradual shift illustrates a key point: fragile beliefs don’t change through external pressure, but through internal motivation. No matter how well-reasoned an argument may be, it’s like introducing a foreign species into a well-defended ecosystem. Real change happens when the mind itself begins to open, allowing new ideas to compete with the old.

When that internal shift occurs, fragile beliefs are forced into competition. And often, when exposed to scrutiny, they don’t hold up. My wife’s belief in homeopathy eventually faded—not because someone convinced her, but because the emotional shelter that had protected it crumbled from within.

This slow erosion reveals something important about how ideas survive or fade away. Fragile beliefs can persist for a long time when protected by emotional attachment, cultural identity, or social reinforcement. But once those protections weaken, and the mind allows scrutiny, these beliefs often collapse. Survival in the mental ecosystem isn’t necessarily about truth—it’s about how well an idea fits into the broader landscape of our thoughts.

In the end, the beliefs that endure are those that can adapt and grow stronger through challenge. Like ecosystems, minds evolve. Some ideas thrive through competition, while others survive by finding refuge. But over time, only the most resilient beliefs—the ones that can withstand scrutiny and adapt to new information—are the ones that continue to thrive.
