# Homeopathy and Other Species

It’s curious how two completely contradictory beliefs can coexist in the same mind without causing any friction. Think of someone who trusts modern medicine enough to get their flu shot in the morning, but later in the day reaches for a homeopathic remedy when they feel a cold coming on. There’s no internal conflict, no cognitive dissonance—just two beliefs, side by side, that never seem to confront one another. What’s going on here? How do these opposing beliefs manage to live together so peacefully?

The answer lies in how the mind operates. Rather than functioning as a perfectly logical machine that constantly filters out falsehoods, it’s more like an ecosystem—a landscape where beliefs, like species, occupy different niches. Some ideas are strong and well-adapted, others fragile and dependent on specific conditions to survive. In this mental ecosystem, beliefs don’t always have to compete directly, as long as they serve different roles. Homeopathy and science, for instance, can coexist because they’re called upon in different contexts—homeopathy for minor ailments, science for serious health concerns. As long as these beliefs stay in their respective corners, there’s no need for confrontation.

But, as in any ecosystem, the balance can shift when the environment changes. Strong ideas thrive because they are adaptable and can withstand challenges, while weaker ideas, though malleable, are fragile and only survive in protected niches. This kind of fragility isn’t immediately obvious because fragile ideas can be highly flexible—able to bend around criticism—but their very flexibility is a sign of weakness. A truly robust idea doesn’t twist to survive; it grows stronger when tested.

Homeopathy, for example, doesn’t hold up scientifically. The core idea—introduced by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th century—is that “like cures like,” meaning that a substance causing symptoms in a healthy person can cure those same symptoms when highly diluted. But these dilutions are so extreme that there’s no trace of the original substance left, which makes the remedy indistinguishable from water or sugar pills. And yet, despite the lack of scientific evidence, homeopathy persists. How can that be?

Part of the answer lies in the context in which homeopathy arose. In the 18th and 19th centuries, mainstream medical treatments like bloodletting and purging were not just ineffective, but often dangerous. In that environment, homeopathy found its niche. It didn’t actively harm people—often, it didn’t do much at all—but doing nothing was an improvement over the dangerous alternatives of the time. Homeopathy thrived because it avoided harm, allowing it to take root as a gentler option when medicine felt too brutal. But survival in the cognitive ecosystem isn’t just about avoiding harm. Ideas survive not simply because they’re true, but because they meet psychological needs. This is where homeopathy truly found its strength.

One of the key reasons people hold onto beliefs like homeopathy, despite their fragility, is emotional attachment. Homeopathy, for many, fills a gap that modern medicine often overlooks—it offers time, care, and attention. Homeopaths spend significant amounts of time with their patients, considering not just their physical symptoms but also their emotional well-being. This kind of personalized attention builds trust in a way that the often clinical and impersonal approach of modern medicine does not. When someone feels seen and understood by their homeopath, the belief in the treatment isn’t just about its efficacy—it’s about the emotional bond that’s formed. In that sense, homeopathy serves a deeper purpose than simply curing symptoms; it fills a role in the emotional landscape of health.

People cling to fragile beliefs like homeopathy because they offer more than just a medical solution—they offer comfort, a sense of control, and often, a connection to a broader worldview. For some, using homeopathy aligns with a desire to engage with natural or holistic treatments, or it represents a rejection of mainstream, industrialized medicine. These emotional and psychological layers create a protective shelter, insulating the belief from the direct pressure of scientific scrutiny. It’s not just about what works or doesn’t work on a biological level; it’s about what feels right.

This emotional attachment acts as a kind of cognitive shelter, protecting the belief from challenges that might otherwise force it into confrontation with stronger, more evidence-based ideas. But this protection doesn’t make the belief more resilient—it makes it more vulnerable in the long run. Beliefs like homeopathy are malleable, bending to fit any new criticism. If a scientific study disproves homeopathy’s effectiveness, its proponents might claim the remedy works on a level beyond current scientific understanding, or that its effects are too subtle to measure. This flexibility isn’t the strength of adaptation—it’s the fragility of a belief that can’t stand up to scrutiny without shifting to accommodate the challenge.

In contrast, strong ideas—like scientific theories—are hard to vary. They evolve based on evidence, but they don’t twist to avoid confrontation. Instead, they grow stronger by refining themselves in the face of challenges. Robust ideas don’t bend—they adapt by incorporating new evidence in ways that reinforce their core structure. Scientific theories, for instance, become more resilient as they survive repeated testing. Like well-adapted species in nature, strong ideas thrive because they are capable of surviving a wide range of conditions without losing their coherence.

But homeopathy isn’t just protected by emotional attachment—it’s also reinforced by culture. In certain social circles, alternative treatments aren’t just medical choices; they’re part of a broader identity. For some, using homeopathy isn’t just about avoiding pharmaceuticals—it’s about participating in a lifestyle that values natural, alternative approaches to health. This cultural reinforcement acts like an artificial shelter, creating an environment where fragile beliefs can survive without facing the full force of cognitive competition. As long as the cultural structures that support homeopathy hold strong, the belief is insulated from the pressures that would normally cause it to collapse.

I’ve seen this dynamic play out firsthand. For years, my wife relied on homeopathy for minor ailments like colds and headaches, while trusting modern medicine for more serious health concerns. The two beliefs existed peacefully, each occupying its own niche in her mental ecosystem. Homeopathy took care of the day-to-day discomforts, while science handled the more critical concerns. But eventually, the balance shifted. She started to question osteopathy, another alternative treatment she had once relied on. That initial skepticism spread, like a disruption in her mental ecosystem, causing her to reevaluate homeopathy as well.

Once the skepticism set in, it created space for cognitive competition. The more robust, evidence-based framework of modern medicine began to take up more space, crowding out the fragile belief in homeopathy. Over time, the emotional and cultural niches that had sheltered homeopathy started to weaken, and it no longer held the same place in her mind. It didn’t collapse immediately, but like a species losing its habitat, it gradually faded, unable to survive the new pressures of scrutiny and doubt.

But not all weak beliefs face this kind of competition. Many survive because they are protected by emotional and cultural reinforcement, thriving in isolated cognitive niches where they aren’t exposed to direct challenge. For some, beliefs like homeopathy persist not because they are the strongest or most logical, but because they fulfill deeper needs—comfort, identity, or meaning. In these cases, the mind doesn’t need the belief to be scientifically sound—it just needs the belief to feel right. And as long as that emotional shelter remains intact, the belief can survive.

The mind’s ecosystem is constantly shifting. Beliefs evolve, compete, and sometimes wither, but the ideas that survive aren’t always the ones that are true—they’re the ones best adapted to their niches. Some ideas thrive through their ability to grow stronger when challenged, integrating new evidence and becoming more robust. Others, like homeopathy, survive because they’re sheltered by emotional attachment or cultural validation. But that shelter can only last so long. In time, the cognitive ecosystem will inevitably change, and only the most robust ideas will thrive.
