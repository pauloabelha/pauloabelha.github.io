# Homeopathy, Allodoxia

This isn’t an essay on the scientific validity of homeopathy. I have no interest in trying to convince people to stop using it or in satisfying those who already dismiss it as pseudoscience. That debate, while important to some, misses a deeper issue that intrigues me more: how we compartmentalize our beliefs in such a way that seemingly contradictory worldviews coexist in harmony.

So what is this essay about? It’s about cognitive siloing—the mental process by which people separate conflicting ideas, keeping them isolated from each other in different parts of their minds. This compartmentalization allows someone to trust science and follow evidence-based guidelines while, at the same time, embracing practices like homeopathy, which many scientific institutions regard as pseudoscientific. It’s a tension that I’ve witnessed firsthand, and it raises a curious question: how do we reconcile the belief in two such opposing systems without experiencing internal conflict?

To make sense of this, it helps to understand what homeopathy actually entails. Developed in the late 18th century by Samuel Hahnemann, homeopathy is built on the idea that “like cures like”—that substances which cause symptoms in a healthy person can be used in a diluted form to treat similar symptoms in someone who is ill. Homeopathy also involves extreme dilution, often to such a degree that not a single molecule of the original substance remains. The final aspect is its deeply personalized approach, with practitioners considering both the patient’s physical symptoms and their psychological state. In contrast, evidence-based medicine (often referred to as allopathy) operates on fundamentally different principles. It relies on empirical data and clinical trials to develop treatments that directly target the causes or symptoms of disease. While homeopathy has little scientific support, allopathy has a foundation of rigorous research.

The historical context is key to understanding why homeopathy gained so much ground in the first place. Medicine in the 18th and 19th centuries was far from the advanced, evidence-based practice we know today. Medical treatments were often painful, ineffective, and even dangerous. Bloodletting and purging were common methods, and they frequently did more harm than good. It’s not difficult to see why, in such an environment, a system like homeopathy—with its gentle, non-invasive remedies—would have found appeal. For many patients, homeopathy offered something conventional medicine couldn’t: treatments that at least didn’t make things worse.

But homeopathy offered more than just physical relief. It was also humane in its approach, emphasizing long consultations, attentiveness, and consideration of the patient’s emotional well-being. This human-centered care was a stark contrast to the often impersonal, mechanical treatments of the time. It’s easy to imagine how patients, feeling seen and heard in a way they hadn’t before, would form a positive emotional attachment to the practice. The very act of being treated with compassion likely generated a sense of well-being, even when the remedies themselves lacked scientific efficacy. This positive emotional experience could easily reinforce their faith in homeopathy, making it less likely that they would question it with the same rational scrutiny they applied to other beliefs.

Emotions play a powerful role in shaping our beliefs. When something makes us feel good or cared for, we are less motivated to challenge it. In the case of homeopathy, patients were not just receiving a treatment; they were being treated with a kind of attention that was often missing in mainstream medicine at the time. This emotional connection insulated homeopathy from the kind of rational critique that might have otherwise come from its lack of empirical support. When you feel better, even if only emotionally, the need to confront the rational inconsistencies of a belief diminishes.

But this isn’t about comparing the two systems. The more interesting question is: why do some people manage to accept both? How is it possible to trust in the rigorous, empirical methods of science while simultaneously holding faith in a treatment that lacks scientific backing?

Cognitive siloing offers a helpful explanation. It’s a kind of mental compartmentalization where conflicting beliefs are kept in separate “silos,” never fully brought into confrontation. This phenomenon became especially evident to me during the COVID-19 pandemic. I knew people who were staunch advocates of vaccination and scientific protocols, following the guidance of health authorities closely. Yet, these same individuals were also devoted to homeopathic remedies. They seemed able to hold these two opposing views without cognitive dissonance, moving easily between the world of scientific medicine and the world of alternative treatments.

What makes this possible? There are several potential reasons, all of which point to how cognitive siloing works. For some, homeopathy is more than just a medical practice—it’s a cultural tradition or a personal belief tied to identity. When a particular treatment or approach is deeply embedded in someone’s life, it becomes insulated from scientific critique. This belief is often reinforced by personal experiences. For instance, someone might have grown up using homeopathy and witnessed what they believe to be its benefits, further cementing their faith in it. In these cases, the belief in homeopathy isn’t subjected to the same critical scrutiny as other beliefs rooted in science, because it operates within a different emotional or cultural context.

Others may never directly confront the contradiction between homeopathy and evidence-based medicine. In everyday life, these beliefs might operate in entirely separate spheres—homeopathy for minor ailments, science for serious medical issues. Because they’re not often required to evaluate the two together, people can move between them without ever feeling the need to reconcile the differences. This mental division keeps potential conflicts at bay, allowing both beliefs to coexist.

In some cases, cognitive siloing is reinforced by the environment. In certain countries, homeopathy is integrated into mainstream healthcare, blurring the lines between alternative treatments and scientific medicine. In such contexts, the tension between the two systems is less pronounced, and individuals don’t see the need to question homeopathy’s legitimacy. When institutions provide tacit approval of both systems, the conflict between them can seem less important.

But the cognitive silos can collapse, often under the pressure of personal reflection or new information. I once knew someone who believed strongly in homeopathy, having used it for years as a primary form of treatment. For a long time, this belief was never questioned; it seemed to work, at least for minor illnesses. But then, a curious thing happened: they became skeptical of another alternative treatment—osteopathy. It seemed to push the limits of what they considered reasonable, especially when certain treatments appeared invasive or unfounded. This initial skepticism led them to investigate further, and in the process, they stumbled across official reports evaluating not just osteopathy, but homeopathy as well. One such report from the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) concluded that homeopathy had no effect beyond placebo.

This discovery prompted a shift in their thinking. It wasn’t an overnight transformation, but over time, they started to see how some of homeopathy’s perceived benefits might be explained by placebo effects or the natural regression of symptoms. They realized that illnesses like colds or minor headaches would have resolved themselves even without any intervention. Eventually, this reflection led them to distance themselves from homeopathy, embracing a more skeptical view informed by evidence. What had once been held in a cognitive silo was now subjected to the same scrutiny as their other beliefs.

This shift reveals something important about cognitive siloing: it persists only so long as there is no compelling reason to tear down the walls between conflicting ideas. When someone is faced with new information or motivated to examine their beliefs critically, the silos can break down. But until then, many people continue to navigate between contradictory systems without much internal conflict.

This process of mental compartmentalization can be understood along two dimensions: opportunity and motivation. In environments where homeopathy is accepted, there’s often little opportunity to confront the tension between it and scientific medicine. Similarly, if someone is emotionally or culturally attached to homeopathy, they may lack the motivation to question it, even when presented with evidence. On the other hand, when both opportunity and motivation are high, as in the case of my acquaintance, the mind is pushed to reconcile these conflicting beliefs.

Ultimately, cognitive siloing offers a useful lens through which to understand how people manage multiple, often conflicting worldviews. Rather than dismissing these contradictions as irrational, we can see them as part of the intricate ways human minds navigate complexity. The ability to hold seemingly incompatible beliefs, such as faith in both science and homeopathy, is a testament to how adaptable and compartmentalized our thinking can be.

At the same time, the breakdown of these silos shows that people are capable of significant intellectual flexibility. When given the right combination of opportunity, motivation, and new information, it’s possible to move beyond the mental compartments we’ve created and bring our beliefs into greater alignment with each other—and with reality.
