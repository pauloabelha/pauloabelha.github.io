# Homeopathy and Other Species

I have a friend who is a staunch supporter of
Science, but she also used to believe in Homeopathy.
To any reasonable degree, there is scientific 
consensus that Homeopathy has no effect. Commonsense
grounded on basic acientific reasoning would also
 indicate that it doesnt make much sense.



Some swear by homeopathy; others dismist it as pseudoscience.
But there are people in the intersection, who are supporters of science and scientific institutions, but also believe in and apply homeopathy in their daily lives.
How can one hold both positions without feeling any internal conflict?

Usual responses might be that homeopathy is in fact theoretically and empirically valid and it is just a matter of not have been integrated into mainstream science yet.
Actualy, in many countries, homeopathy is part of mainstream medical practice, often being suggested as treatment alongside standard scientific options.
I personally think this explains the majority of people holding both positions together.

However, we would still need to explain how would people still hold on to their homeopathy belief even in the face of evidence from respected scientific institutions and general understanding of current scientific knowledge. 
We might just dismiss this as assuming that that humans can hold contradictory beliefs and that's it.
Ok, but we do not think it is raining _and_ that the sky is clear.
So, the interesting point is how can our minds hold on to seemingly contradictory beliefs, such as being pro-science and a believer in homeopathy.
Is it just because these beliefs are more complex, and that two complex things can never be in complete direct conflict? Or is there something more to it?

Perhaps we’ve been thinking about beliefs too narrowly. We often assume that beliefs are either true or false, supported by evidence or not, and that those which don’t measure up should naturally fall away. But this view oversimplifies how our minds actually work. What if, instead of imagining the mind as belief machine, we thought of it as a kind of ecosystem? In this mental ecosystem, ideas behave like species. Some are robust and thrive through direct competition. Others are more delicate, finding sheltered niches where they persist without having to face the scrutiny of logic or evidence.

Take homeopathy, for instance. The principle of “like cures like,” proposed by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 1700s, posits that substances causing symptoms in a healthy person can cure those same symptoms when administered in highly diluted doses. Scientifically, this doesn’t hold up. There is no empirical mechanism for how it could work, particularly when some dilutions leave no trace of the original substance. Yet despite the lack of scientific support, homeopathy persists. Why? Because it provides something science often does not: time, attention, and care.

When you visit a homeopath, it’s not just about the remedy—it’s about the experience of being listened to, understood as a whole person rather than a set of symptoms. This creates trust, and trust is powerful. Even if the belief itself is weak under scrutiny, the emotional connection forms a kind of protective barrier. Homeopathy survives in an emotional niche, shielded from the full glare of scientific skepticism.

What’s striking is that for many who hold these beliefs, they don’t feel like contradictions. Science, based on evidence and competition of ideas, might dominate their worldview. But this dominance doesn’t necessarily crowd out other beliefs. Homeopathy, for example, survives not because it competes directly with science, but because it occupies its own niche—like a species thriving in a remote valley, far from the predators of the open plains.

This phenomenon isn’t limited to homeopathy. Take astrology. Despite no scientific basis for the claim that the positions of celestial bodies influence daily life, millions still check their horoscopes. Astrology endures, not because it can withstand scientific critique, but because it fulfills emotional needs. It offers comfort, a sense of control, and even a cosmic narrative that science doesn’t provide. In this way, fragile beliefs like astrology and homeopathy aren’t necessarily in direct competition with the robust species of scientific ideas—they exist in parallel, each in its own niche, serving different purposes.

The persistence of these beliefs points to something deeper: they provide more than just intellectual satisfaction. They connect to identity, culture, and personal meaning. Rejecting homeopathy, for instance, might feel like rejecting part of one’s identity or community. The belief is not only personal but socially reinforced, like a species thriving in a carefully managed habitat.

However, not everyone’s mental ecosystem is equally receptive to fragile beliefs. Some people develop what could be called cognitive biodiversity early on—a mind rich with diverse, strong, interwoven ideas that leave little space for fragile species. I have a friend who, by the age of eight, was fascinated by dinosaurs. His early understanding of biology, deep time, and evolution naturally led him to question the religious teachings he encountered at church. His mental ecosystem was already populated with ideas about science, and there was simply no room for the belief that the Earth was only a few thousand years old. It couldn’t take root.

In his case, it wasn’t just one belief replacing another. His mind was a richly populated ecosystem, where concepts from geology, biology, and evolution interacted and reinforced each other. When you have that level of complexity and interconnection, fragile beliefs struggle to find a foothold. They’re crowded out by more resilient, evidence-based ideas that have evolved over time.

Now, contrast that with someone who grows up with less exposure to diverse ideas. In a simpler cognitive ecosystem, fragile beliefs can more easily take root and grow. Without the challenge of competing ideas, these beliefs can thrive, filling mental spaces that might otherwise be occupied by stronger, more rigorously tested thoughts.

This points to a crucial insight: early exposure to a wide range of ideas can create a mental ecosystem that is resilient to fragile beliefs. Rational, evidence-based thinking becomes like an established species, crowding out ideas that might otherwise flourish in an underdeveloped cognitive environment.

That’s not to say that all beliefs develop this way. For many, beliefs like homeopathy or astrology are deeply entrenched, protected more by emotional or cultural ties than by logic. My wife, for example, once believed in homeopathy. Not casually, but with deep conviction. No amount of logical argument or scientific evidence would have changed her mind—at least not directly. In fact, trying to convince her might have only strengthened her attachment, much like a fragile species becoming more dependent on its sheltered environment.

Over time, however, something changed. She began to question osteopathy, another alternative practice she had long trusted. That small crack in her belief system weakened the emotional barriers protecting homeopathy. Once she started to question one belief, others had nowhere to hide. Her mind began to allow competition, and fragile beliefs, when forced into competition with stronger, more rational ideas, often can’t survive.

This gradual shift illustrates a key point: fragile beliefs don’t change through external pressure, but through internal motivation. No matter how well-reasoned an argument may be, it’s like introducing a foreign species into a well-defended ecosystem. Real change happens when the mind itself begins to open, allowing new ideas to compete with the old.

When that internal shift occurs, fragile beliefs are forced into competition. And often, when exposed to scrutiny, they don’t hold up. My wife’s belief in homeopathy eventually faded—not because someone convinced her, but because the emotional shelter that had protected it crumbled from within.

This slow erosion reveals something important about how ideas survive or fade away. Fragile beliefs can persist for a long time when protected by emotional attachment, cultural identity, or social reinforcement. But once those protections weaken, and the mind allows scrutiny, these beliefs often collapse. Survival in the mental ecosystem isn’t necessarily about truth—it’s about how well an idea fits into the broader landscape of our thoughts.

In the end, the beliefs that endure are those that can adapt and grow stronger through challenge. Like ecosystems, minds evolve. Some ideas thrive through competition, while others survive by finding refuge. But over time, only the most resilient beliefs—the ones that can withstand scrutiny and adapt to new information—are the ones that continue to thrive.
