# Homeopathy, allodoxia

It’s interesting how two seemingly contradictory beliefs can live together in the same mind without ever confronting each other. You know the type: someone who reads medical journals, trusts in modern vaccines, and yet takes a homeopathic remedy for a cold as if it’s part of the same worldview. We tend to gloss over this contradiction, but there’s something worth exploring here. How do these beliefs—one grounded in evidence, the other largely unsupported—manage to coexist so comfortably?

The answer, I think, lies in how our minds are structured. We like to think of ourselves as rational beings, weighing evidence and making choices accordingly, but the mind isn’t really a logical sorting machine. It’s more like an ecosystem. In an ecosystem, different species don’t have to compete all the time. They occupy different niches, live off different resources, and don’t always have to face off directly. The same goes for our beliefs. Homeopathy might handle the minor stuff—headaches, colds, stress—while science steps in for the big things—cancer, infections, surgeries. As long as these beliefs stay in their respective roles, there’s no need for conflict.

But just like in nature, balance in this mental ecosystem can be disturbed. Introduce a new pressure—new information, personal doubt, or external challenge—and suddenly those once-separate beliefs are forced to compete. The result is much like what happens in nature: some ideas adapt and evolve, while others wither and die off.

Take homeopathy. The idea itself isn’t hard to explain—Samuel Hahnemann, in the late 18th century, proposed that a substance causing symptoms in a healthy person could cure those same symptoms when diluted. But the dilutions are so extreme that not a single molecule of the original substance remains, which defies what we know about chemistry and biology. And yet, homeopathy persists. Why?

The answer lies in part in its history. When homeopathy emerged, mainstream medicine was often brutal. Bloodletting and purging were standard treatments, and in many cases, they caused more harm than good. Homeopathy offered a kinder alternative—it didn’t necessarily help, but at least it didn’t make things worse. In that environment, the idea found fertile ground. People were desperate for treatments that didn’t hurt, and homeopathy, by doing nothing harmful, found its niche.

But the survival of homeopathy isn’t just about avoiding harm. It also thrives because it addresses something that science often neglects: emotional care. Homeopaths spend time with their patients, listening to not only their physical symptoms but also their emotional concerns. It’s not just about the remedy—it’s about being seen and understood. In a world where modern medicine can sometimes feel cold and impersonal, homeopathy fills a different kind of need. It thrives in this niche because it gives patients the sense that they’re being cared for on a deeper level, even if the scientific basis of the treatment is weak.

That’s why people can trust science for one set of problems and homeopathy for another. These beliefs are kept in different mental spaces, each serving its own purpose. Homeopathy handles the small stuff, while science is trusted for life-or-death situations. As long as these beliefs stay in their respective roles, they never have to confront each other. But cognitive ecosystems, like natural ones, are always in flux. Something can come along—an idea, a personal experience—that forces these beliefs into direct competition.

I saw this dynamic play out in a personal way with my wife. For years, homeopathy and evidence-based medicine coexisted peacefully in her mind. She turned to homeopathy for minor ailments—things like colds and headaches—and relied on science when something more serious arose. They each occupied their own cognitive niche. But that balance was fragile, and eventually, it was disrupted.

Her skepticism started with osteopathy, another alternative treatment. Osteopathy had been something she trusted, but over time, she began to notice that it didn’t really hold up under scrutiny. The treatments felt vague, lacking the kind of clear, empirical foundation that modern medicine is built on. That doubt started small, but it grew. Once she began questioning osteopathy, it triggered a chain reaction in her mind, spreading to other alternative treatments, including homeopathy. The once-stable balance between homeopathy and science began to shift.

Suddenly, homeopathy and evidence-based medicine were no longer peacefully coexisting. They were forced into competition. New information—like studies debunking the efficacy of homeopathy—entered her cognitive ecosystem, and it created a pressure that homeopathy couldn’t withstand. In an ecosystem, when two species compete directly for the same resources, the more adaptable one survives. In my wife’s mind, evidence-based medicine proved to be the stronger, more resilient belief. Homeopathy, lacking the same adaptability, began to wither. Over time, it lost its place in her mental landscape.

This kind of cognitive competition is how beliefs evolve. We don’t often consciously confront our beliefs, but when something disrupts the balance—new evidence, personal experiences, or simply a growing sense of inconsistency—the beliefs that can’t adapt tend to fade away. The ones that are more adaptable, the ones better grounded in evidence and logic, survive. It’s not that we’re irrational—it’s just that, like any ecosystem, the mind maintains balance until something forces change.

Interestingly, people who entertain a broader range of ideas tend to be more open to this kind of cognitive evolution. It’s as though the more species you allow in your mental ecosystem, the more opportunities there are for competition. Someone who holds only a few, rigid ideas may never experience the cognitive pressure needed to force a shift in their thinking. But when you allow for many ideas—when you actively expose yourself to conflicting beliefs or new information—you’re setting up a situation where the strongest ideas, the most evidence-based beliefs, will have a chance to win out.

In my wife’s case, it was the broadness of her thinking that eventually led her to embrace evidence-based medicine more fully. The initial doubt about osteopathy created the opportunity for a broader reevaluation, and that’s the key. When you allow your beliefs to compete in the open—when you’re willing to put them to the test—stronger ideas naturally emerge. It’s like a natural selection of ideas. The mental ecosystem favors the adaptable, the evidence-based, the ideas that can survive under pressure.

This is why people who are curious, who expose themselves to a wide variety of ideas, tend to gravitate toward beliefs that can hold up under scrutiny. The more you challenge your own ideas, the more competition you invite into your cognitive ecosystem, the more likely it is that the weaker beliefs will eventually die off. It’s not always a quick process, and it’s not always comfortable, but it’s how we grow.

In the end, it’s not just about science versus homeopathy. It’s about how we handle our beliefs. The mind, like nature, is constantly evolving. When we allow for cognitive competition, when we expose our ideas to new pressures and force them to adapt, the beliefs that survive are the ones that can withstand the test. Ideas, like species, thrive not because they’re static, but because they can evolve.
