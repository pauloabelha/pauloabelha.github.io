# Homeopathy

This is not an essay on the scientific validity of homeopathy. I have no interest in convincing people to stop using homeopathy nor in indulging those who already think homepathy is scientifically invalid. This is of little use. Perhaps of some use to a small set of people, but these are marginal cases that call for another essay. What then _is_ this essay about? Well, it is about _cognitive siloing_ and how we compartmentalize world views. 

Homeopathy is first a binary take on the possibilities of handling diseases. Homeo-pathy for "like cures like": the idea that cure for one or more conditions comes from subtances that would cause similar symptoms in a healthy individual. Mostly the substances are also diluted as it is believed that this increases the potency of the solution. This dilution can reach the order of 10^60, where a scientific consideration would say that there is virtually no chance of finding a single molecule of the original substance in the final diluted solution. Finally, there is a close assessment of the patient, including not only symptoms and physical complaints, but also psychological peculiarities like temperament and preferences. Of course there are variations and different schools of thought within homeopathy, but in general these would be the three main pillars.

Allopathy is the idea that a condition could be cured by a substance different from the causes or symptoms of the condition. Having these two names for the two approaches seems to indicate they stand in equal footing. But this duality is a trick: We cannot elevate ideas with the touch of a prefix. Evidence-based medicine and alternative medicine are two sets of approaches, but to confront them is to make a category mistake. They belong to very different ways of explaining reality. As we will see, the resolution comes not from confronting them, but from understanding the motives behind the split. 

Medicine in the 18th century was no joke, just search for bloodletting or purging. Medical treatments were innefective, painful and often detrimental. A fertile ground for approaches that simply did nothing to the patient, such as homeopathy. Well, and this is the main point, perhaps it _did_ offer something; not an effective biochemical treatment, but a humane one. Homepathy traveled from Germany to the United States and to the rest of the world. And it travelled through well educated and well informed doctors in constrast to local quackery of uneducated healers. From the start, homeopathy had great features: simple conceptual system; long consultation time; and emotionally aware, patient-centered interactions. As the Enlightenment entered the dark rooms of hospitals, homeopathy gave way to evidence-based medicine. Effective treatments incurred an exponential growth in knowledge and technique. As much as we like  to complain about current affairs, 21st century medicine in nothing short of a miracle in the long history of our civilization.

Fast forward over two hundred years and, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I met people who were at the same time pro-Science and pro-homeopathy. These were people with vigorous stances on the importance of following guidelines from scientific and governmental institutions. For many countries, these same institutions would consider homeopathy to be in the realm of pseudoscience and outside the scope of public funding and serious consideration. What to make of it? We should get vaccinated because reputable scientific institutions have an immense body of evidence for its efficacy and importance. But, when they tell us homeopathy is pseudoscience, we can disregard that and choose to continue to support homeopathic paractice. Can we have it both ways?

I do not intend the last paragraph to be a rhetorical device. I do believe this question opens up an interesting line of thinking. How can we conciliate a mind that believes in homeopathy, but also believes that we should follow scientific institutional guidelines for vaccination? Well, top-of-mind hypothetical answers could be:
1) The mind has not had the opportunity to confront these two positions;
2) The mind has had the opportunity, but there is negative value associated to letting go of one belief as it might be attached to strong emotional memories;
3) Some cultures might have homeopathy be part of scientific discourse and thus there would be no contradiction;
4) Homeopathy could be seen as a personal faith-based choice and thus shielded from the scientific culture surrounding the individual
5) Perhaps for some, the fight for following governmental guidelines is tied more strongly to a political view than to a scientific one (left being pro vaccine; and right, anti-vax).

We can think of two axes: opportunity and motivation.
- Low opportunity and low motivation:
- Low opportunity and high motivation:
- High opportunity and low motivation:
- High opportunity and high motivation: When both are high, the mind has enough volition to conciliate positions. 


There seems to be then two threads: one relates to the mind not having had the opportunity of pursuing conciliation; and the other, on creating a priori divisions within the mind, where certain ideas are not to be confronted with others. The first thread
