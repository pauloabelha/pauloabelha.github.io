# Homeopathy and Other Species

Contradictions fascinate me. They make us human — yet we also crave resolution. We name them in others, but rarely face our own. They live quietly inside us, stitched into habit, barely tugging at the seams.

Left alone, they settle in - some for a lifetime. Opposing ideas share the same mind, but the tension is rarely enough to make them clash.

It ised ti be natural thinking evidence could unravel them — that a contradiction was like a knot waiting for reason to untangle it.

This changed when I saw something rare: a friend quietly letting go of her belief in homeopathy — not because someone argued her out of it, but because something deeper in her had begun to shift.

She’s always supported science. She trusted research, followed evidence, defended vaccines. And yet, for years, she also believed in homeopathy — despite the broad scientific consensus against it.

Some might believe that homeopathy has simply been overlooked by mainstream science, but still deserves respect as a valid form of knowledge. This view isn’t entirely unreasonable: in many countries, homeopathy is part of formal medical practice and is sometimes recommended alongside standard scientific treatments. That probably explains why many people feel no conflict.

We might be tempted to dismiss this by saying that humans can simply hold contradictory beliefs. But that feels too easy. After all, we don’t believe it’s raining and that the sky is clear at the same time. So what allows our minds to hold certain contradictions without discomfort — like being pro-science while also believing in homeopathy? Is it just that complex ideas rarely come into direct collision? Or is there something deeper at work?

Perhaps we’ve been thinking about beliefs too narrowly. We often assume that beliefs are either true or false, supported by evidence or not, and that those which don’t measure up should naturally fall away. But this view oversimplifies how our minds actually work. What if, instead of imagining the mind as a belief machine, we thought of it as a kind of ecosystem? In this mental ecosystem, ideas behave like species: some are robust and thrive through direct competition, while others are more delicate, surviving in sheltered niches where they are shielded from the scrutiny of logic or evidence.

Take homeopathy, for instance. The principle of "like cures like," proposed by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 1700s, holds that substances causing symptoms in a healthy person can cure those same symptoms when administered in highly diluted doses. Scientifically, this doesn’t hold up: there is no known empirical mechanism for how it could work, especially when dilutions leave no trace of the original substance. Yet despite the lack of scientific support, homeopathy persists — because it provides something science often does not: time, attention, and care.

When you visit a homeopath, it’s not just about the remedy. It’s about the experience of being listened to, of being understood as a whole person rather than reduced to a set of symptoms. This creates trust — and trust is powerful. Even if the belief itself is fragile under scrutiny, the emotional connection forms a kind of protective barrier. Homeopathy survives in an emotional niche, shielded from the harsh glare of scientific skepticism.

What’s striking is that for many who hold these beliefs, they don’t feel like contradictions. Science, based on evidence and competition of ideas, might dominate their worldview. But this dominance doesn’t necessarily crowd out other beliefs. Homeopathy, for example, survives not because it competes directly with science, but because it occupies its own niche—like a species thriving in a remote valley, far from the predators of the open plains.

This phenomenon isn’t limited to homeopathy. Take astrology. Despite no scientific basis for the claim that the positions of celestial bodies influence daily life, millions still check their horoscopes. Astrology endures, not because it can withstand scientific critique, but because it fulfills emotional needs. It offers comfort, a sense of control, and even a cosmic narrative that science doesn’t provide. In this way, fragile beliefs like astrology and homeopathy aren’t necessarily in direct competition with the robust species of scientific ideas—they exist in parallel, each in its own niche, serving different purposes.

The persistence of these beliefs points to something deeper: they provide more than just intellectual satisfaction. They connect to identity, culture, and personal meaning. Rejecting homeopathy, for instance, might feel like rejecting part of one’s identity or community. The belief is not only personal but socially reinforced, like a species thriving in a carefully managed habitat.

However, not everyone’s mental ecosystem is equally receptive to fragile beliefs. Some people develop what could be called cognitive biodiversity early on—a mind rich with diverse, strong, interwoven ideas that leave little space for fragile species. I have a friend who, by the age of eight, was fascinated by dinosaurs. His early understanding of biology, deep time, and evolution naturally led him to question the religious teachings he encountered at church. His mental ecosystem was already populated with ideas about science, and there was simply no room for the belief that the Earth was only a few thousand years old. It couldn’t take root.

In his case, it wasn’t just one belief replacing another. His mind was a richly populated ecosystem, where concepts from geology, biology, and evolution interacted and reinforced each other. When you have that level of complexity and interconnection, fragile beliefs struggle to find a foothold. They’re crowded out by more resilient, evidence-based ideas that have evolved over time.

Now, contrast that with someone who grows up with less exposure to diverse ideas. In a simpler cognitive ecosystem, fragile beliefs can more easily take root and grow. Without the challenge of competing ideas, these beliefs can thrive, filling mental spaces that might otherwise be occupied by stronger, more rigorously tested thoughts.

This points to a crucial insight: early exposure to a wide range of ideas can create a mental ecosystem that is resilient to fragile beliefs. Rational, evidence-based thinking becomes like an established species, crowding out ideas that might otherwise flourish in an underdeveloped cognitive environment.

That’s not to say that all beliefs develop this way. For many, beliefs like homeopathy or astrology are deeply entrenched, protected more by emotional or cultural ties than by logic. My wife, for example, once believed in homeopathy. Not casually, but with deep conviction. No amount of logical argument or scientific evidence would have changed her mind—at least not directly. In fact, trying to convince her might have only strengthened her attachment, much like a fragile species becoming more dependent on its sheltered environment.

Over time, however, something changed. She began to question osteopathy, another alternative practice she had long trusted. That small crack in her belief system weakened the emotional barriers protecting homeopathy. Once she started to question one belief, others had nowhere to hide. Her mind began to allow competition, and fragile beliefs, when forced into competition with stronger, more rational ideas, often can’t survive.

This gradual shift illustrates a key point: fragile beliefs don’t change through external pressure, but through internal motivation. No matter how well-reasoned an argument may be, it’s like introducing a foreign species into a well-defended ecosystem. Real change happens when the mind itself begins to open, allowing new ideas to compete with the old.

When that internal shift occurs, fragile beliefs are forced into competition. And often, when exposed to scrutiny, they don’t hold up. My wife’s belief in homeopathy eventually faded—not because someone convinced her, but because the emotional shelter that had protected it crumbled from within.

This slow erosion reveals something important about how ideas survive or fade away. Fragile beliefs can persist for a long time when protected by emotional attachment, cultural identity, or social reinforcement. But once those protections weaken, and the mind allows scrutiny, these beliefs often collapse. Survival in the mental ecosystem isn’t necessarily about truth—it’s about how well an idea fits into the broader landscape of our thoughts.

In the end, the beliefs that endure are those that can adapt and grow stronger through challenge. Like ecosystems, minds evolve. Some ideas thrive through competition, while others survive by finding refuge. But over time, only the most resilient beliefs—the ones that can withstand scrutiny and adapt to new information—are the ones that continue to thrive.
