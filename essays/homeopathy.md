# Homeopathy, allodoxia

This isn’t about whether homeopathy works. That question has been debated endlessly, and I’m not interested in trying to settle it here. What I find more intriguing is why homeopathy still holds sway over so many people who, at the same time, put their faith in modern medicine. It’s not a contradiction they feel. Somehow, both beliefs sit comfortably together, side by side, never really colliding. And the more I think about it, the more I wonder: how do we manage to live with ideas that don’t seem to belong in the same space?

Take homeopathy. Developed in the late 18th century by Samuel Hahnemann, it’s based on the idea that “like cures like”—that a substance causing symptoms in a healthy person can be diluted and used to treat those same symptoms in someone who’s ill. There’s something almost mystical in the way homeopathy relies on extreme dilutions—dilutions so strong that not a single molecule of the original substance remains. Yet, for those who practice it, the absence of the substance somehow increases its power. And then there’s the personal side of it. Homeopathy doesn’t just focus on physical symptoms; it takes into account the whole person—how they feel, their temperament, their emotional state.

Compare this to modern medicine, often referred to as allopathy, which takes a very different approach. It’s rooted in data, clinical trials, and the scientific method. Treatments are tested, outcomes measured, and results scrutinized. There’s a confidence in the numbers, in the predictability. And yet, here we are, with many people living comfortably with both systems, trusting one in some cases and the other in different ones.

It’s easy to see how homeopathy gained ground in the first place. In the 18th and 19th centuries, medicine wasn’t what it is today. Back then, bloodletting, purging, and dangerous treatments were common. Often, the so-called cure was worse than the disease. Homeopathy offered an alternative—one that didn’t harm the patient. It was gentle, non-invasive, and didn’t make things worse. In that sense, it was almost revolutionary. But there’s more to it. Homeopathy didn’t just treat the body; it treated the person. Practitioners took time with their patients, listened to their stories, and paid attention to their emotional needs. That must have felt different—more humane. And in a world of crude medical practices, it’s not hard to imagine why people would form a deep emotional connection to it.

This emotional care matters. People didn’t just leave homeopathic treatments feeling better physically—they left feeling heard. And that’s a powerful thing. When someone listens to you, when they really pay attention, it creates a bond, a sense of trust. That trust makes it harder to question the treatment, even when it doesn’t align with what science tells us. You feel better—maybe not because of the medicine itself, but because of the experience. And when we feel better, we rarely ask why.

But what’s really interesting isn’t just the emotional attachment to homeopathy. It’s how people manage to hold onto it while also believing in modern medicine. This ability to live with conflicting ideas—what I’ve come to think of as cognitive siloing—is fascinating. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I saw people I knew who were strong advocates for vaccines and scientific protocols, yet they still reached for homeopathic remedies when they got a cold. It wasn’t that they rejected science. In fact, they trusted it deeply. But homeopathy occupied a different part of their thinking, never colliding with their belief in evidence-based medicine.

How do we do this? How do we keep these conflicting ideas so neatly separated? For some, I think homeopathy goes beyond just being a medical practice. It’s tied to cultural traditions, to family history, to personal identity. When a belief is woven into your life in that way, it’s hard to subject it to the same critical analysis you might apply to other beliefs. There’s a lot of personal experience involved, too. Maybe you took a remedy once and felt better, or maybe you grew up watching someone in your family swear by it. Those moments stick. They reinforce the belief in a way that’s immune to outside scrutiny because they come from something deeply personal.

For others, the contradiction between homeopathy and science may never need to be confronted. In everyday life, we can let these beliefs operate in separate domains—homeopathy for minor ailments, science for serious conditions. As long as they’re kept apart, there’s no need for them to clash. They stay in their own lanes, so to speak, and we move between them easily without having to reconcile the differences.

Sometimes, the environment itself supports this separation. In some countries, homeopathy is part of the healthcare system, right alongside conventional medicine. When both are sanctioned by trusted institutions, the lines between them blur. There’s no urgency to pick one over the other, no pressing need to question their coexistence. The mental silos remain intact, reinforced by the world around us.

But these silos aren’t impenetrable. I knew someone who used homeopathy for years without ever questioning it. It worked for them—until they started to become skeptical of another alternative treatment: osteopathy. Osteopathy felt off to them, too vague, too ungrounded. That initial doubt led them down a path of inquiry, and before long, they were reading studies on homeopathy as well. Eventually, they came across a report from the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) that labeled homeopathy as nothing more than a placebo. It wasn’t an immediate shift, but over time, they started to see how many of the benefits they had attributed to homeopathy might just be the natural resolution of illnesses. The silos began to break down.

It’s not that cognitive siloing is permanent. It persists as long as there’s no reason to challenge it. When we’re faced with new information or feel motivated to re-examine our beliefs, those silos can collapse. But until that moment comes, we’re able to move through life with these contradictions, never really needing to resolve them.

What’s interesting is that most people don’t feel the conflict. We’re remarkably good at holding onto conflicting beliefs without feeling the need to reconcile them. And maybe that’s the real mystery—not why we do it, but why we’re so comfortable letting those silos stand, untouched.
