# Homeopathy and Other Species

Contradictions fascinate me. We spot them all around us: in systems, institutions, and people. They settle in quietly, weaving themselves into the stories we live by. Left alone, they can last a lifetime. And trying to expose them rarely works — as I learned when a friend’s belief in homeopathy quietly collapsed.

I used to think evidence could unravel a contradiction — that it was like a knot waiting for reason to untangle it. This changed when I saw my friend let go of her belief. Not because someone argued her out of it. For all I know, none of our brief discussions changed much of her opinion.

She’d always supported science. She trusted research, followed evidence, defended vaccines. And yet, for years, she also believed in homeopathy — despite the broad scientific consensus against it.

In many cultures, homeopathy doesn’t feel unscientific. It’s folded into formal medical systems, sometimes even recommended alongside scientific treatment. That may be why many people feel no internal conflict. Some see it not as pseudoscience, but as a knowledge system neglected by mainstream research. That belief can persist even in the face of evidence.

I brought it up a few times — how it defies science, how most serious institutions now treat it as pseudoscience. It made little difference. She didn’t argue, but she closed off — as if the conversation brushed against something she needed to keep balanced.

I had been thinking about beliefs too narrowly. Seeing them as probably true or false, supported by evidence or not — and that those which don’t measure up should naturally fall away. But that view oversimplifies how our minds actually work. What if, instead of imagining the mind as a belief machine, we saw it as a kind of ecosystem?

In this mental ecosystem, ideas behave like species. Some thrive in open air — resilient, competing, spreading across the mind. Others survive only in the shade, nestled near stronger ideas or drawing quiet support from emotion. Fragile beliefs don’t stand alone. They persist by leaning on sturdier ones, or by settling into pockets of warmth and protection. What endures isn’t always what’s strongest, but what finds a place.

What’s striking is that holding science and homeopathy together doesn’t strike a contradiction. Science — based on method and evidence — might dominate the intellectual terrain. But dominance doesn’t always lead to extinction. Homeopathy, for instance, survives not by confronting science, but by retreating from its path — like a plant growing in the underbrush, unnoticed by the larger canopy.

This becomes clearer when you understand its emotional role. Visiting a homeopath isn’t just about the remedy. It’s about being listened to, about being seen whole. That experience builds trust — and trust, in this landscape, acts like shelter from the wind. Emotions aren’t background noise here. They shape the contours. They decide which ideas can take root, and which find the air too thin.

I’ve come to think of these pockets of emotional protection as **epistemic microclimates** — small, stable zones where fragile beliefs survive despite the harsher intellectual weather around them.

This isn’t unique to homeopathy. Take astrology. Despite lacking any scientific foundation, it fulfills emotional needs: narrative, comfort, a sense of pattern in chaos. It offers not facts but stories — stories that give shape to feeling. And in the mind, stories often settle more deeply than arguments.

So fragile beliefs like astrology and homeopathy don’t compete directly with science. They grow alongside it, in different places. They thrive not because they’re strong, but because they fit — into lives, into moods, into memory.

Their persistence points to something deeper. These beliefs are not purely intellectual. They’re social, cultural, emotional. Rejecting homeopathy, for some, might feel like turning away from a shared past. The belief isn’t a lone tree in the clearing. It’s part of a grove — reinforced by the soil and the shade around it.

Not all minds offer the same terrain. Some people develop what you might call cognitive biodiversity early on — a dense tangle of interlocking ideas. I have a friend who, by age eight, was already obsessed with dinosaurs. That early grasp of evolution and deep time left little room for certain religious stories. Fragile beliefs didn’t even get the chance to germinate.

His mind wasn’t cleared of contradiction by force. It was filled with something else — geology, biology, astronomy — each reinforcing the others. In that thicket, unsupported ideas had nowhere to land.

Now contrast this with someone who grows up in simpler mental surroundings. In open, unchallenged terrain, fragile beliefs spread easily. There’s space, and little resistance. Complexity isn’t just decoration — it’s a kind of defense.

This leads to something important. Rational thinking doesn’t just dismantle fragile beliefs. It reshapes the ground. It creates an environment where certain ideas — the vague, the flimsy — can’t find footing. Early exposure to complexity doesn’t just train the mind. It alters the climate.

Still, not all beliefs give way to reason. Some are rooted in habit, memory, or love. My wife, for example, once believed deeply in homeopathy. No argument would have changed her mind. The belief wasn’t floating — it was anchored in trust. It had shade.

Over time, something shifted. She began to question osteopathy — a belief nearby, part of the same cluster. That small change let in light. The canopy thinned. Without the cover it had long enjoyed, homeopathy began to fade. When the conditions change, the belief often follows.

This points to a broader truth. Beliefs rarely collapse from a single blow. They wither. They erode. Not by force, but by a slow loss of shelter — a shift in the emotional weather, a change in what feels safe to hold.

When the mind opens, ideas must compete. Some take hold. Others fall away. My wife’s belief didn’t fall to evidence. It faded because the space that had once held it no longer felt like home.

In the end, what survives isn’t just what’s right. It’s what fits. Ideas live or die not only by the strength of their claims, but by the world they inhabit — the trust they evoke, the ground they cover, the shade they share. Like ecosystems, minds change. And with time, only the beliefs that can stand the light remain.
