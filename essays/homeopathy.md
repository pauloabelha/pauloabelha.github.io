# Homeopathy, Allodoxia

This isn’t an essay about whether homeopathy works. For the scientific community, that debate was settled long ago. And yet, millions of people, many of whom trust modern medicine, still swear by it. How is that possible? What’s happening in the mind when we can embrace both evidence-based treatments and remedies dismissed as pseudoscience? The answer lies not in medicine, but in how we organize and protect our beliefs.

Homeopathy is a prime example of this cognitive paradox. Developed in the late 18th century by Samuel Hahnemann, homeopathy rests on the idea that “like cures like”—that a substance which causes symptoms in a healthy person can, when diluted, treat similar symptoms in someone who is ill. These dilutions often reach levels where not a single molecule of the original substance remains, yet homeopaths believe the treatment becomes more potent. It’s also highly personalized, taking into account not just physical symptoms, but the patient's emotional and psychological state. By contrast, evidence-based medicine—often called allopathy—relies on rigorous clinical trials and empirical data to treat disease. Where allopathy targets causes directly, homeopathy operates on a principle that science largely regards as pseudoscience.

But this essay isn’t about comparing the two systems. It’s about something more elusive: how someone can trust the methods of modern science while simultaneously embracing homeopathy, a practice rooted in ideas that science rejects. In other words, it’s about how we compartmentalize our beliefs in a way that lets two opposing worldviews coexist.

To understand why homeopathy took hold, it’s useful to consider the historical context. In the 18th and 19th centuries, medicine was a far cry from the sophisticated, evidence-based practice we know today. Treatments were often painful, ineffective, and even dangerous. Bloodletting, purging, and the use of toxic substances were common. In such an environment, homeopathy—with its gentle, non-invasive approach—was a welcome alternative. For many, it did no harm, and in an era when doing nothing was often better than the harsh methods of conventional medicine, this was a kind of success.

Yet homeopathy’s appeal wasn’t just in its treatments. It offered a humane, patient-centered approach. Practitioners spent long hours with patients, listening to their complaints and treating them as whole individuals rather than a collection of symptoms. This stood in stark contrast to the often cold and mechanical nature of mainstream medicine. Homeopaths treated patients with compassion, offering them time and attention in ways that conventional doctors didn’t. The emotional connection fostered by this care likely reinforced a sense of well-being, even when the remedies themselves were ineffective.

When we feel cared for, the need to challenge the belief behind that care fades. Emotions shape our beliefs, and the act of feeling seen, listened to, and understood can make us less inclined to scrutinize the logic behind it. This explains why many people continue to believe in homeopathy, even when its scientific basis is questionable. The emotional experience is real, and it’s powerful enough to override the absence of empirical support.

This is where cognitive siloing comes in. It’s the mental process by which we separate conflicting ideas into different compartments, keeping them from confronting each other. This phenomenon was especially apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. People who fervently advocated for vaccination, followed scientific guidelines, and trusted health authorities still reached for homeopathic remedies when faced with everyday ailments. There seemed to be no tension between the two beliefs—one rooted in modern science, the other in a system most scientists would call pseudoscientific. Each belief occupied its own space, never intruding on the other.

Why does this happen? One reason is that homeopathy often transcends the category of medicine alone; it’s woven into cultural traditions and personal identities. People who grew up using homeopathy, watching family members swear by its effectiveness, are likely to see it as more than just a remedy—it’s part of who they are. Personal experiences further cement these beliefs. If someone uses homeopathy and feels better, even if due to placebo or the natural resolution of symptoms, that experience becomes proof of the treatment’s value. In these cases, homeopathy isn't subject to the same critical analysis as scientific beliefs, because it's operating within a different emotional and cultural context.

For some, the contradiction between homeopathy and evidence-based medicine simply never needs to be confronted. In daily life, these beliefs function in separate domains—homeopathy for minor ailments, science for serious medical issues. The two are kept apart, each used when appropriate. This mental division allows people to move between conflicting beliefs without ever needing to reconcile them.

In certain environments, cognitive siloing is further reinforced by external validation. In some countries, homeopathy is part of the healthcare system, making it less controversial and more accepted alongside conventional medicine. If trusted institutions approve both systems, individuals feel no urgency to question the legitimacy of either. The compartmentalization remains intact.

But these silos can break down under the weight of new information or personal reflection. I once knew someone who used homeopathy for years without ever questioning its efficacy. It worked for them—until they began to encounter other alternative treatments that felt questionable. Their skepticism toward one form of alternative medicine sparked a broader inquiry. Over time, they began reading studies, including a report from the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) that debunked homeopathy as little more than placebo. This research, combined with a growing realization that illnesses like colds would have resolved themselves naturally, led them to reconsider their long-held belief. It wasn’t an abrupt change, but slowly, the cognitive compartments started to collapse, and homeopathy was no longer protected from scrutiny.

What this shows is that cognitive siloing isn’t fixed. It persists as long as there is no compelling reason to challenge it. When faced with new information or a motivation to examine these beliefs more critically, those silos can crumble. Until then, though, most people are able to move through life without confronting the contradictions between their beliefs.

This dynamic of opportunity and motivation helps explain why some beliefs stay siloed while others fall apart. Where homeopathy is culturally accepted, there’s little reason to confront the tension with science. And when a belief is tied to personal experience or emotional well-being, the motivation to question it weakens. Only when both opportunity and motivation align, as they did for my acquaintance, do the silos begin to break down.

In the end, it’s not that people don’t recognize the conflict between homeopathy and science. It’s that, for the most part, they don’t have to. The mind, after all, is remarkably good at holding contradictions without feeling the need to resolve them. And perhaps that’s what makes these silos so resilient—the fact that, unless something forces us to tear them down, we’re more than content to let them stand.
