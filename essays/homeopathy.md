# Homeopathy and Other Species

Contradictions fascinate me. We spot them all around us: in systems, institutions, and people. They settle in quietly, weaving themselves into the stories we live by. Left alone, they can last a lifetime. And trying to expose them rarely works — as I learned when a friend’s belief in homeopathy quietly collapsed.

I used to think evidence could unravel a contradiction — that it was like a knot waiting for reason to untangle it. This changed when I saw my friend let go of her belief; on her own, not because someone argued her out of it. For all I know, none of our brief discussions changed much of her opinion.

She’d always supported science. She trusted research, followed evidence, defended vaccines. And yet, for years, she also believed in homeopathy — despite the broad scientific consensus against it.

In many cultures, homeopathy doesn’t _feel_ unscientific. It’s folded into formal medical systems, sometimes even recommended alongside scientific treatment. That may be why many people feel no internal conflict. Some see it not as pseudoscience, but as a knowledge system neglected by mainstream research. That belief can persist even in the face of evidence.

I brought it up a few times — how it defies science, how most serious institutions now treat it as pseudoscience. It made little difference. She didn’t argue, but she closed off — as if the conversation brushed against something she needed to keep balanced.

The truth is: I had been thinking about beliefs too narrowly. Seeing them as probably true or false, supported by evidence or not — and that those which don’t measure up should naturally fall away. Emotions were just enhancers or blockers. I couldn’t see how contradictions might survive even when exposed. That view, of course, oversimplifies how minds work. What if, instead of imagining the mind as a belief machine, we saw it as a kind of ecosystem?

In this mental ecosystem, ideas behave like species. Some thrive in open air — resilient, competing, spreading across the mind. Others survive only in the shade, nestled near stronger ideas or drawing quiet support from emotion. Fragile beliefs don’t stand alone. They persist by leaning on sturdier ones, or by settling into pockets of warmth and protection. What endures isn’t always what’s strongest, but what finds a place.

But beliefs don’t merely coexist — they cluster. They form symbiotic networks, like plants sharing root systems or fungal webs beneath a forest floor. One belief shelters another, or supplies it with nutrients — emotional, cultural, narrative. A fragile belief may persist not by its own strength, but by its connections. In this way, minds don’t just host ideas; they cultivate interdependent ecologies. Beliefs co-evolve. Some even act parasitically, drawing energy from others without offering much in return. A conspiracy theory, for instance, might leech credibility from legitimate doubt without supplying coherence of its own. Others form mutualisms — reinforcing each other so tightly that neither would survive alone.

Homeopathy is just one such species, adapted to the shaded corners of a mind that also harbors many scientific ones. Astrology grows nearby. Despite lacking scientific foundation, it fulfills other roles — emotional patterning, symbolic coherence, a sense of rhythm in disorder. It doesn’t compete with science directly. It survives by feeding a different part of the psyche.

Their persistence points to something deeper. These beliefs are not purely intellectual. They’re social, cultural, emotional. Rejecting homeopathy, for some, might feel like turning away from a shared past. The belief isn’t a lone tree in the clearing. It’s part of a grove — reinforced by the soil and the shade around it.

Not all minds offer the same terrain. Some people develop what you might call cognitive biodiversity early on — a dense tangle of interlocking ideas. I have a friend who, by age eight, was obsessed with dinosaurs and the scientific concepts surrounding them. He told me how, even then, he felt something odd about what the priest was preaching in Sunday church. His early grasp of evolution and deep time left little room for certain religious stories. Fragile beliefs didn’t even get the chance to germinate.

His mind wasn’t cleared of contradiction by force. It was filled with something else — geology, biology, astronomy — each reinforcing the others. In that thicket, unsupported ideas had nowhere to land. There was no battle — just no room. Other young minds might find a way to integrate religious teachings, but his had just the right population and balance to reject it. The preached concepts could not take root in that ecosystem.

Now contrast this with a mind that grows up in sparse mental surroundings. In open, unchallenged terrain, fragile beliefs spread easily. There’s space, and little resistance. Complexity isn’t just decoration — it’s a kind of defense.

This leads to something crucial. Rationality doesn’t dismantle fragile beliefs through logic alone. It’s not about syllogisms. It’s about what fits. A mind full of interconnected ideas will find it harder to absorb fragile ones. There are too many points of conflict. The weak belief has nowhere to hide.

Thinking about young minds again: early exposure to challenges that call for the creation of complex ecosystems doesn’t just train the mind. It alters the climate.

Going back to my friend’s collapse of belief in homeopathy — over time, something shifted. It started when she began to question osteopathy — a belief nearby, part of the same cluster. She found out about the controversies surrounding it. Also about the possible dangers to babies and children. That possibility of harm destabilized part of her ecosystem. The canopy thinned. Without the cover it had long enjoyed, homeopathy began to collapse.

Something in her now allowed the evidence against homeopathy to take root. She began to read everything — a week-long reckoning of her own. After a week or two, it was overtly clear: homeopathy made no sense. That new position is now part of her. She has no intention of going back.

This points to a broader truth. Beliefs rarely collapse from a single blow. They wither. They erode. Not by force, but by a slow loss of shelter — a shift in the emotional weather, a change in what feels safe to hold.

When something shakes the mind, ideas must compete. Some take hold. Others fall away. My friend’s belief didn’t fall to evidence. It faded because the space that had once held it no longer felt like home.

In the end, what survives isn’t just what’s right. It’s what fits. Ideas live or die not by the strength of their claims, but by the world they inhabit — the trust they evoke, the ground they cover, the shade they share. Contradictions may last for years — but in the end, only the beliefs that no longer need the shade remain.
