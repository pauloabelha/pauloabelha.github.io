# Homeopathy and Other Species

This is not an essay on the scientific validity of homeopathy. I have no interest in convincing people to stop using homeopathy nor in indulging those who already think homeopathy is scientifically invalid. This is of little use. Perhaps of some use to a small set of people, but these are marginal cases that call for another essay. What then is this essay about? Well, it's about how homeopathy is but one of a myriad of idea species that thrive and interact in the ecosystem of our mind.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I met people who were at the same time pro-Science and pro-homeopathy. These were people with vigorous stances on the importance of following guidelines from scientific and governmental institutions. For many countries, these same institutions would consider homeopathy to be in the realm of pseudoscience and outside the scope of public funding and serious consideration. What to make of it? We should get vaccinated because reputable scientific institutions have an immense body of evidence for its efficacy and importance. But, when they tell us homeopathy is pseudoscience, we can disregard that and choose to continue to support homeopathic practice. Can we have it both ways?

This raises an interesting question. How is it that people can hold these two seemingly contradictory beliefs in their minds without conflict? How do they square their trust in rigorous, evidence-based science with their belief in something like homeopathy, which lacks the same scientific grounding?

But perhaps we’ve been approaching this too rigidly. I invite you to think of the mind not as a purely rational machine, but as an ecosystem—a landscape where ideas, like species, find their own niches. Some ideas are robust and adaptable, thriving under scrutiny and evolving through challenges. Others are more fragile, surviving in protected spaces where they don’t have to face direct competition. Homeopathy, I’d argue, is one of those fragile ideas, flourishing not in the open fields of scientific validation, but in sheltered pockets of emotional attachment or cultural identity.

Consider homeopathy. The principle it’s based on—“like cures like”—was introduced by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th century. It suggests that substances that produce symptoms in a healthy person can cure those same symptoms when given in highly diluted forms. The dilutions often reach such extremes that not a single molecule of the original substance remains. From a scientific standpoint, homeopathy doesn’t hold up; there’s no empirical basis for it. And yet, people believe it works. Why? Because homeopathy offers something that science doesn’t—time, care, and personal attention. A homeopath listens, spending time with the patient, focusing not just on symptoms but on the person’s overall emotional and physical state. This creates trust, and trust is a powerful force. It makes ideas stick, even if they wouldn’t survive under the harsh light of scientific scrutiny.

But what’s really fascinating is how beliefs like homeopathy can coexist with scientific ones, without either feeling like an intruder. In some minds, science dominates, flourishing because it’s built on evidence, rigor, and adaptability. These minds are like ecosystems full of robust species—ideas that grow stronger by facing challenges. Science thrives on this competition. Homeopathy, on the other hand, is a fragile belief. Scientifically speaking, it wouldn’t hold up if forced into direct competition with modern medicine. So how does it survive?

It survives because it’s not competing directly. Homeopathy occupies a protected niche, a space where it doesn’t have to confront the rigors of scientific reasoning head-on. It’s protected by something deeper—emotional attachment. This attachment works like a mountain range in the mind, shielding homeopathy from the cognitive competition it would face if exposed to scrutiny. In this emotional valley, homeopathy thrives, not because it’s the strongest or most logical idea, but because it’s safe. It fulfills needs that science doesn’t, offering a sense of control, comfort, and a belief in something personal, even if that belief can’t be scientifically proven.

This isn’t just about emotion. Cultural reinforcement plays a role too. In some communities, homeopathy isn’t just a medical choice; it’s part of a broader identity. Rejecting it would mean rejecting a whole set of values, social ties, or even personal history. In these cases, cultural validation acts as an additional layer of protection, much like a species benefiting from a carefully managed habitat. As long as that cultural support remains, homeopathy can continue to thrive, unchallenged by the broader landscape of scientific ideas.

But here’s the thing: it wasn’t an external argument or confrontation that eroded the mountain range protecting my wife’s belief in homeopathy. She wasn’t persuaded by anyone trying to convince her. A direct confrontation from someone else—no matter how logical or evidence-based—would have had little effect. It might have even strengthened her emotional attachment to homeopathy, the way an external predator strengthens a fragile species' reliance on its protected niche.

In the ecosystem of the mind, an external challenge—someone else’s argument—acts like a foreign species trying to invade. If the mental ecosystem is well-protected, the challenge will be repelled. No amount of logical reasoning could break down the emotional barrier protecting homeopathy in her mind. This is why debates with people holding fragile beliefs are often futile. The belief isn’t competing directly with science because it doesn’t need to. It’s shielded, surviving in a protected niche, and those emotional or cultural protections won’t fall because of an argument.

Instead, what ultimately led to the erosion of my wife’s belief in homeopathy was an internal shift, a subtle and slow intrinsic motivation. It started with her growing skepticism of osteopathy, another alternative treatment she had trusted. As she began to question osteopathy, the emotional barriers protecting her other beliefs, like homeopathy, started to weaken. This wasn’t because of external pressure, but because her own mind was now ready to allow cognitive competition to take place.

Without intrinsic motivation, a belief as emotionally entrenched as homeopathy doesn’t change. It has to come from within—the mind itself must begin to see the contradictions, must begin to dismantle the emotional mountains that have been protecting the fragile belief. In my wife’s case, her own growing doubt acted like a tectonic shift, slowly removing the shelter that had protected homeopathy for so long. Once she was motivated to scrutinize it herself, the belief had no place to hide.

But if that internal motivation hadn’t been there, no amount of external argument would have mattered. The emotional mountain range would have remained, shielding homeopathy from any cognitive competition. Without that internal drive, homeopathy could have continued to thrive in its protected space, unthreatened by even the most rigorous scientific reasoning. Change comes from within, not from external confrontation.

This gradual weakening of a belief, once protected, shows how fragile ideas can persist for a long time if they remain sheltered. But once exposed to direct competition with more robust ideas, they often fail to hold up. And yet, not all fragile beliefs face such competition. Many continue to thrive, living in the mental niches sheltered by emotional attachment or cultural identity. For some, beliefs like homeopathy survive not because they are the strongest or most logical, but because they meet deeper needs. As long as the mountain range of emotional attachment stays intact, the belief can survive indefinitely, protected from the harsher landscape of evidence and reason.

But just as ecosystems are constantly changing, so too is the mind. Beliefs evolve, grow, and sometimes fade away. The ideas that endure aren’t always the ones that are true—they’re the ones best adapted to the niches they inhabit. Some ideas grow stronger when challenged, incorporating new evidence and becoming more robust. Others, like homeopathy, survive because they’re sheltered. But those shelters can only last so long. Eventually, the cognitive landscape shifts, and only the most robust ideas will continue to thrive.
