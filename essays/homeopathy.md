# Homeopathy and Other Species

It’s curious how two completely contradictory beliefs can coexist in the same mind without causing any friction. Think of someone who trusts modern medicine enough to get their flu shot in the morning, but later in the day reaches for a homeopathic remedy when they feel a cold coming on. There’s no internal conflict, no cognitive dissonance—just two beliefs, side by side, that never seem to confront one another. What’s going on here? How do these opposing beliefs manage to live together so peacefully?

The answer lies in how the mind operates. Rather than functioning as a perfectly logical machine that constantly filters out falsehoods, it’s more like an ecosystem—a landscape where beliefs, like species, occupy different niches. Some ideas are strong and well-adapted, others fragile and dependent on specific conditions to survive. In this mental ecosystem, beliefs don’t always have to compete directly, as long as they serve different roles. Homeopathy and science, for instance, can coexist because they’re called upon in different contexts—homeopathy for minor ailments, science for serious health concerns. As long as these beliefs stay in their respective corners, there’s no need for confrontation.

But like any ecosystem, the mind is constantly evolving, and when conditions change, the balance between these beliefs can shift. Strong ideas thrive because they are adaptable and can withstand challenges, while weaker ideas, though malleable, are fragile and only survive in protected niches.

Take homeopathy, for example. Scientifically, it doesn’t hold up. The core idea—introduced by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th century—is that “like cures like,” meaning that a substance causing symptoms in a healthy person can cure those same symptoms when highly diluted. But these dilutions are so extreme that there’s no trace of the original substance left, which makes the remedy indistinguishable from water or sugar pills. And yet, despite the lack of scientific evidence, homeopathy persists. How can that be?

Part of the answer lies in the context in which homeopathy arose. In the 18th and 19th centuries, mainstream medical treatments like bloodletting and purging were not just ineffective, but often dangerous. In that environment, homeopathy found its niche. It didn’t actively harm people—often, it didn’t do much at all—but doing nothing was an improvement over the dangerous alternatives of the time. Homeopathy thrived in this cognitive landscape because it avoided harm, allowing it to take root as a gentler option when medicine felt too brutal.

But homeopathy’s survival isn’t just about avoiding harm. It also filled an emotional role. Homeopaths spent significant time with their patients, considering not only their physical symptoms but also their emotional well-being. This personalized care built trust in a way that modern medicine, with its clinical and often impersonal approach, didn’t. Patients felt heard, seen, and understood—and that feeling created a protective niche for homeopathy in their minds. In the cognitive ecosystem, ideas don’t survive simply because they’re true; they survive because they meet psychological needs.

What’s fascinating is that beliefs like homeopathy can survive despite being weak. They are malleable, easily bent and reshaped to fit any criticism. If a scientific study disproves homeopathy’s effectiveness, its proponents may shift their explanation—claiming the remedy works on a level that’s beyond current scientific understanding, or that it’s effective in ways too subtle to measure. But this malleability doesn’t make the belief stronger; it makes it fragile. Like a species that survives only because of a temporary, unstable condition in the environment, weak beliefs can twist to accommodate criticism, but they never gain true robustness. They remain on the edge of collapse, clinging to narrow, emotionally protected niches.

In contrast, strong ideas—like scientific theories—are adaptable in a different way. They evolve based on evidence, refining themselves without losing their core coherence. In nature, the species that thrive are those that can adapt to a wide range of conditions without fundamentally changing what makes them successful. Similarly, strong ideas are hard to vary. They resist being twisted into new forms every time they’re challenged. Instead, they grow stronger by facing scrutiny and integrating new evidence. This kind of adaptability is a sign of robustness—the ability to withstand challenges without breaking or becoming incoherent.

In this way, the mind’s ecosystem is a constant balancing act between robust ideas, which evolve and grow stronger through evidence, and fragile beliefs, which survive by bending around criticism. But fragile beliefs are always vulnerable to collapse if the conditions that protect them—emotional attachment, cultural reinforcement—begin to fade.

I saw this dynamic play out firsthand. For years, my wife trusted homeopathy for minor ailments like colds and headaches while relying on evidence-based medicine for more serious health issues. The two beliefs existed peacefully, occupying separate roles in her cognitive ecosystem. Homeopathy took care of the day-to-day discomforts, while science handled the more critical concerns. But that balance eventually shifted. She began to grow skeptical of osteopathy, another alternative treatment she had once relied on. The initial doubt spread like a disruption in her mental ecosystem, causing her to reevaluate not just osteopathy, but homeopathy as well.

Her skepticism acted like a new pressure in her cognitive environment. Once she started questioning one alternative treatment, it created space for cognitive competition. The more robust structure of evidence-based medicine began to take up more space, crowding out the fragile, easily varied beliefs like homeopathy. Over time, homeopathy—once sheltered in its emotional niche—couldn’t survive the new cognitive pressures. It didn’t collapse immediately, but like a species slowly losing its habitat, it began to fade, no longer able to thrive under the weight of scrutiny.

But not all weak beliefs face such competition. Many survive because they are protected by emotional or cultural support, surviving in isolated cognitive niches where they are rarely exposed to direct challenge. People hold on to these beliefs not because they’re the strongest or most logical, but because they fulfill other needs—comfort, meaning, or identity. In these cases, the mind doesn’t need the belief to be scientifically sound; it just needs the belief to feel right. And as long as that emotional shelter remains intact, the belief persists.

In the end, the mind’s ecosystem is constantly shifting. Beliefs evolve, compete, and sometimes wither. The ideas that survive are not always the ones that are true, but the ones that are best adapted to their niches. Some thrive through adaptability, growing stronger through evidence and challenge. Others, like homeopathy, survive because they’re sheltered by emotional attachment—but that shelter can only last so long. In time, the cognitive ecosystem will inevitably change, and only the most robust ideas will thrive.
