# Homeopathy

This is not an essay on the scientific validity of homeopathy. I have no interest in convincing people to stop using homeopathy nor in indulging those who already think homepathy is scientifically invalid. This is of little use. Perhaps of some use to a small set of people, but these are marginal cases that call for another essay. What then _is_ this essay about? Well, it is about _cognitive siloing_ and how we compartmentalize world views. 

Homeopathy is first a binary take on the possibilities of handling diseases. Homeo-pathy for "like cures like": the idea that cure for one or more conditions comes from subtances that would cause similar symptoms in a healthy individual. On top of this we have dilution of these substances to untraceable quantities. Finally, a close assessment of the patient, including not only symptoms and physical complaints, but also psuchological peculiarities like temperament and preferences.

Alo-Pathy is the idea that a condition _could_ be cured by a subtance different from the causes or symptoms of the condition. Having these two names for the two approaches seems to indicate they in equal standing. But the duality is a trick: 
Evidence-based medicine and alternative medicine are two sets of approaches, but to confront them is to make a category mistake. They belong to very different ways of explaining reality. As we will see, the resolution comes not from confronting them, but from understanding the motives behind the split. 

Medicine in the 18th century was no joke. If you want, search for bloodletting or purging. Medical treatments were innefective, painful and often detrimental. A fertile ground for approaches that simply did nothing to the patient, such as homeopathy. Well, and this is the main point, perhaps it _did_ offer something; not an effective biochemical treatment, but a humane one. Homepathy traveled from Germany to the United States and to the rest of the world. And it travelled through well educated and well informed doctors in constrast to local quackery of uneducated healers. From the start, homeopathy had great features: simple conceptual system; long consultation time; and emotionally aware, patient-centered interactions. As the Enlightnment entered the dark rooms of hospitals, homeopathy declined in popularity. Effective treatments incurred an exponential growth in knowledge and technique. As much as we like  to complain about current affairs, 21st century medicine in nothing short of a miracle in the long history of our civilization.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I met people who were pro-Science and pro-homeopathy. People with vigorous stances on the importance of following guidelines from scientific and governmental institutions. For many countries, these same institutions would consider homeopathy to be in the realm of pseudoscience and outside the scope of public funding and serious consideration. What to make of it? We should get vaccinated because reputable scientific institutions have an immense body of evidence for its efficacy and importance. But, when they tell us homeopathy is pseudoscience, we can disregard that and choose to continue to support homeopathic paractice. Can we have it both ways?

I do not intend the last paragraph to be a rhetorical device. I do believe this question opens up an interesting line of thinking. Well, top-of-mind hypothetical answers would be: People are distracted. They haven't stopped to think about it. Some countries have a scientific culture trying to justify homeopathy and thus it is seen as part of the scientific realm. Homeopathy could be seen as a personal choice of faith and thus shielded from the scientific culture surrounding the individual. Perhaps for some, the fight for following governmental guidelines is tied more strongly to a political view than to a scientific one (left being pro vaccine; and right, anti-vax).
