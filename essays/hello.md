Hello,

I write to think. A ritual of honesty—a chant to the better angels of my mind.

Each essay is a still frame from a journey toward clarity.
Though I’m a scientist by training, these writings aren't academic.
They're crafted versions of what I’d share with you by a quiet fireside.

Thank you for reading.
