Hello,

I write to think.
A small ritual of honesty,
a chant for the better angels of my mind.

Like you, I echo Captain Ahab:
"_Speak, thou vast and venerable head [...] O head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!_"

Thank you for reading.
