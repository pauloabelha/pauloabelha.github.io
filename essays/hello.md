Hello,

I write to think. A ritual of honesty—a chant to the better angels of my mind.

Each essay here is a stillframe from a journey toward clarity.
Though I’m a scientist by training, these writings aren’t academic—nor are they thought dumps.

If we met by a fireside on a clear night, I’d call them reflections aimed at the stars.

Thank you for reading.
