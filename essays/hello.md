Hello,

I write to thinkâ€”to trace the noble dust to better uses. This is a small ritual of honesty, a chant for the better angels of my mind.

Like you, I echo Captain Ahab:
"Speak, thou vast and venerable head [...] O head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!"

Thank you for listening.
