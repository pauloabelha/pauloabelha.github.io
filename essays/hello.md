Hello,  

I write to think. A ritual of honestyâ€”a chant to the better angels of my mind.  

We all hope the universe might write back. For now, we write to each other.  
Like you, I echo Captain Ahab: *"Speak, thou vast and venerable head [...] O head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!"*  

Thank you for reading.
