Hey,

Writing helps me think. This is my search to be completly honest - chanting for the better angels of my mind.
Though words, however embodied, shall not last, I guess we write to that something will transform, or respond.
And like you, and Captain Ahab, I say: "Speak, thou vast and venerable head, [...] O head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!"

Thank you.
