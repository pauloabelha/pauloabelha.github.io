Why is there anything rather than 

Why Anything

Why is there anything rather than nothing?

It’s the question that pretends to be foundational but is, in fact, a trapdoor. What it secretly asks for is a terminus—a fixed point for all ‘why’ questions. A place where asking ends. But ‘why’ can’t ever get you there. Not really. It loops.

Every ‘why’ presumes a structure of causality and legibility. A grammar of reasoning that rests on something else—a floor, a base, a cause, a will, a law. But when you ask why anything, you are asking for the cause of the framework itself. You are asking the canvas to account for its own fabric.

God, in many traditions, is smuggled in precisely here. A fixed point by definition. But that’s cheating. It’s naming the edge of intelligibility and pretending it’s an answer. God becomes not a presence but a placeholder. A variable standing in for everything we cannot derive.

So let’s be honest: ‘Why’ breaks here. It tries to light a match in a vacuum. A better gesture is to stop asking ‘why’ and start noticing that. That this is. That being beats in every direction. That somethingness floods your perception before you can frame a single syllable.

And there, perhaps, you can meet what I call The Primal.

Not an agent. Not a cause. Not a god. Just the groundless ground. The isn’t-that-weird pulse that precedes concept. The Primal isn’t something you explain. It’s what meets you when explanation breaks. You don’t talk to it—you collapse into it.

Words don’t survive the encounter. Concepts try to touch it and fail. You can only stand at its edge and say: this is where my thought ends. Not because it is irrational, but because it is prior to the ratio itself.

That’s our limit.

And strangely, that limit is sacred—not because it points to a divine will, but because it humbles the will to understand. It lets us see the frame around all asking. And maybe, in that seeing, we stop needing a fixed point. Maybe we let go.

And maybe that’s enough.
