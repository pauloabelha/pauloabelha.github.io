# 🧠 Epistemological Cube of AI Systems  
### Inspired by Jean Piaget’s *Constructivist Epistemology*  
### Extended with Benchmark Diagnostics and Epistemic Claims

## 🧠 Central Thesis

Knowledge is not a mirror of reality, but a **constructive process**. Intelligence arises not from copying external forms but from **internal operations**, **transformations**, and the ability to **generalize over them**.  
The most profound epistemic acts are not comparisons, but **transformations of transformations**.

## 🧊 Epistemological Cube: Mapping Theories of Intelligence

Piaget’s critique of knowledge can be clarified and contrasted across **three fundamental axes**, each with two poles. Together they define an **8-corner epistemology cube**, where different theories or AI systems can be located.

### 🧱 The 3 Axes

| Axis | Pole A | Pole B |
|------|--------|--------|
| **1. Source of Knowledge** | **Empirical** — derived from experience | **A Priori** — built-in structure and capacities |
| **2. Internal Change** | **Static** — structure fixed; only parameters tune | **Self-Organizing** — internal structure evolves |
| **3. Epistemic Power** | **Inductive** — generalizes patterns | **Generative** — creates new abstractions/frameworks |

### 🧠 The 8 Corners of the Cube

| ID | Name | Source | Internal Change | Epistemic Power | Summary |
|----|------|--------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| **1** | Statistical Learner | Empirical | Static | Inductive | Learns patterns from data with fixed architecture |
| **2** | Creative Absorber | Empirical | Static | Generative | Hypothetical: learns from data, invents new abstractions |
| **3** | Adaptive Patternizer | Empirical | Self-Organizing | Inductive | Builds internal adaptation schemes from experience |
| **4** | Developmental Constructivist | Empirical | Self-Organizing | Generative | Constructs abstractions over time from embodied interaction |
| **5** | Inductive Formalist | A Priori | Static | Inductive | Encodes symmetry or structure; generalizes from it |
| **6** | Logical Rationalist | A Priori | Static | Generative | Symbolic systems with innate rules; generate explanations |
| **7** | Structured Adapter | A Priori | Self-Organizing | Inductive | Structured systems that update and learn internal representations |
| **8** | Universal Explainer | A Priori | Self-Organizing | Generative | Self-modifying, generative, explanatory agents |

### 🧠 Examples Placed in the Cube

| ID | Label | Example Systems / Thinkers |
|----|-------|-----------------------------|
| **1** | Statistical Learner | LLMs (GPT, BERT), V-JEPA, supervised CNNs, classical RL |
| **2** | Creative Absorber | Hypothetical future multi-modal AGIs; maybe emergent in next-gen JEPA+LLMs |
| **3** | Adaptive Patternizer | Model-based Meta-RL (Dreamer, PlaNet), evolutionary programs |
| **4** | Developmental Constructivist | Piaget’s child, Gary Drescher’s schema engine |
| **5** | Inductive Formalist | GDL, CNNs with strong priors, Vision Transformers |
| **6** | Logical Rationalist | GOFAI, Cyc, theorem provers |
| **7** | Structured Adapter | Neuro-symbolic planners, learned modular systems |

## 🌌 Deep Philosophical Attractors for Each Cube Corner

| Corner | Core World‑Picture | Lived Ethos | Hidden Axioms |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **1** | *Neo‑Humean empiricism* | Engineering positivism, benchmark hustle | “Prediction ≈ truth.” |
| **2** | *Romantic emergentism* | Techno‑sublime hopefulness | “Feed the beast, novelty will emerge.” |
| **3** | *Cybernetic functionalism* | Adaptive pragmatism | “Control beats comprehension.” |
| **4** | *Process ontology* | Embodied learning over time | “Structures must be constructed.” |
| **5** | *Platonised empiricism* | GPU-optimized elegance | “Symmetry is truth.” |
| **6** | *Rationalist foundationalism* | Proofs and logic | “Symbols refer.” |
| **7** | *Pragmatic pluralism* | Hybrid engineering | “No silver bullet.” |
| **8** | *Critical rationalism* | Universal constructors | “Knowledge = explainer creation.” |

> **Meta-takeaway**: technical arguments often conceal metaphysical assumptions.

## 🧪 Benchmark Epistemology: “Benchmark Inflates Your Epistemic Claim”

### ❗ What It Means

> You’re claiming epistemic depth (e.g., reasoning, abstraction, understanding),  
> but your system only passed a **shallow benchmark**.  
> **You tested pattern-matching but claimed generativity.**

This leads to **epistemic inflation** — misclassifying a system’s intelligence class based on benchmark performance.

### 🧠 Example:
LLMs pass IMO problems → claim “mathematical reasoning.”  
But solving via pattern retrieval is not abstract structural reasoning.

→ Appears like Corner 6 or 8 (Rationalist, Explainer)  
→ But is still at Corner 1 or 2 (Statistical Learner, Creative Absorber)  
→ **Benchmark inflates your epistemic claim.**

## 🧠 Core Principle

> Your **epistemic claim** is only as deep as your **benchmark allows**.  
> Most benchmarks test **performance**, not **constructive generativity**.

Use the Cube and this diagnostic table to **ground epistemic humility**, **evaluate capability claims**, and **design deeper tests**.
