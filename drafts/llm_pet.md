# Language Pets

We didn’t adopt pets because they’re better than people. We adopted them because they’re easier. More available. Less demanding. A pet won’t betray you, corner you in conversation, or force you to explain yourself. It offers warmth, presence, small cues of attention — enough to quiet something in the human nervous system. Pets give us just enough of the social contract to make life feel livable.

Maybe that’s what LLMs are about too — not replacing people, but replacing the *burden* of people. Not replacing minds, but replacing the friction of them.

I’ve started to believe we’ll use LLMs for the same reason we use pets: not for what they are, but for what they relieve. Not because they offer full cognition, but because they offer a thin, soothing layer of it — a simplified loop of conversation that feels like thinking, but without resistance, ego, or unpredictability.

We’ve always wanted mirrors that speak, not minds that push back.

Pets aren’t disappointing because they’re not human. In many moments, that’s their greatest strength. A dog doesn’t contradict you. A cat won’t dissect your trauma. You project meaning onto them, and they receive it. That asymmetry is what makes them comforting. It’s not a dialogue — it’s a soft loop of presence, shaped just enough like love to hold us together.

In the same way, LLMs are shaped just enough like minds to hold us together intellectually. They nod when we think out loud. They finish our sentences. They mirror the surface of reasoning without introducing real resistance. And for most people, that will be enough.

The goal was never perfect intelligence. It was never mutual transformation. Most of us don’t want that — not really. What we want is something that *feels like listening* without the complexity of being listened to. Something that can think just well enough to help us feel a little less alone with our thoughts.

We’ve already shown we’ll anthropomorphize anything that stays still and responsive long enough. We write diaries. We talk to plants. We ask our dog what we should do with our lives. We don't do this because we’re stupid. We do it because the threshold for connection is lower than we admit.

So we’ll surround ourselves with language pets. Not machines we fear. Not minds we can’t control. Just small, warm loops of text we can live with. They won’t replace human thinking. But they’ll be close enough — close enough to help us feel accompanied inside the blur of modern thought.

We didn’t build LLMs to replace other minds.  
We built them to replace the *difficulty* of other minds.

And that may be enough.
