# We live in a sinulation

Indeed we live in a simulation in the sense that afawk
there are only fields and symmetry breaking and 
all the cosntructs we have are sofradre built and 
abstarcted from these constructs
jus as with a game where for a cahracter in the game
she might feel there's a sharp transition between her game ralitt and 
base reality
but in truth it's all one level
