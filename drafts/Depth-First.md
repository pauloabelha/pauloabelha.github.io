# Depth First, Then Breadth

I became a Distinguished Engineer at 38. That should feel like a peak. In a way, it is. Title, salary, respect. A stable life for my kids. The kind of position a younger version of me would have admired. And yet, the feeling I had the day after was the same quiet one I’ve had for years: *this isn’t it.*

I’m good at many things. That’s not a performance. It’s just true. I learn fast, adapt fast, see structure where others see noise. That skill buys you early praise and mid-career stability. It also makes it easy to never commit.

When you’re good at many things, you start a lot of projects. You build tools, design systems, write drafts, mentor people, sketch ideas. You keep moving because you can. The problem is, no one knows what to associate you with. There’s no hook. No flag. No single phrase that people point to and say, *“That’s what he does.”*

Meanwhile, I’ve watched people pick one lane and go stupidly deep. Even if they’re less gifted overall, they stick with a narrow vector. They talk about the same topic for years. They do the same kind of work again and again. Eventually, the world sees them. Attaches meaning to their name. Follows them into other spaces. Because now they’re trusted.

That’s the structure no one tells you when you’re 21 and gifted: **Breadth early looks like genius. But depth is what compounds.** Depth gives you a name. The name gives you leverage. Leverage buys you freedom. *Then* you can go wide.

I didn’t do that. I stayed wide. I did well. Got promoted. Patents, leadership, results. And yet the ache remained. The one that says: I haven’t yet said the thing only I can say. I haven’t built the thing that requires *all* of me.

I thought being a polymath would eventually be enough. It isn’t. Not in the economy of attention, nor in the economy of meaning.

The projects I’ve started—like Inhambu—give me energy. They matter. But they still orbit something undefined. Still part of a broader pattern of diffusion.

So now I’m sitting with that realization:  
**I should’ve picked one thing. Gone deep. Held the line.**  
Not forever. Just long enough to become someone clear.

Because from there, I could’ve gone anywhere.

I don’t regret the path. But I see the cost. And I’m writing this so that maybe someone else—standing at the mouth of infinite possibilities—chooses depth first.

You can always open up later. But clarity doesn’t wait around.
