# Homeopathy

This is not an essay on the scientific validity of Homeopathy. The scientific validation arena is best left to explanations of reality that aim to fight in it. You could pick your favourite collection of serious scientific studies that debunk homepathy; cite the various national health institutions that do not fund nor support it; appeal to how many deeply rooted scientific theories would have to be re-built from scratch if homepathy were true. This is of little use. Perhaps of some use to <1% of people, but these are marginal cases that call for anoteher essay. What then is _this_ essay about? Well, it is about _cognitive siloing_ and how we compartmentalize world views. 

Homeopathy is first a binary take on the handling of diseases. Homeo-pathy for "like cures like" and Alo-Pathy for "different cures like".
