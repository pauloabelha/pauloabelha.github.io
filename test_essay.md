# Homeopathy

This is not an essay on the scientific validity of homeopathy. The scientific validation arena is best left to explanations of reality that aim to fight in it. You could pick your favourite collection of serious scientific studies that debunk homepathy; cite the various national health institutions that do not fund nor support it; appeal to how many deeply rooted scientific theories would have to be re-built from scratch if homepathy were true. This is of little use. Perhaps of some use to a small set of people, but these are marginal cases that call for another essay. I have no interest in convincing people to stop using homeopathy nor in indulging those who already think homepathy is scientifically invalid. What then _is_ this essay about? Well, it is about _cognitive siloing_ and how we compartmentalize world views. 

Homeopathy is first a binary take on the possibilities of handling diseases. Homeo-pathy for "like cures like" and Alo-Pathy for its complement. Splitting the world of ideas make it seem that both sets deserve equal standing. Of course we can always split the world into the set _for_ a position and the set _against_ a position. Evidence-based medicine and alternative medicine are two sets of approaches, but to confront them is to make a category mistake. They belong to very different ways of explaining reality. As we will see, the resolution comes not from confronting them, but from understanding the motives behind the split.

Medicine in the 18th century was no joke. If you want, search for bloodletting or purging. Medical treatments were innefective, painful and often detrimental. A fertile ground for approaches that simply did nothing to the patient, such as homeopathy. Well, and this is the main point, perhaps it _did_ offer something; not an effective biochemical treatment, but a humane one. Homepathy traveled from Germany to the United States and to the rest of the world. And it travelled through well educated and well informed doctors in constrast to local quackery of uneducated healers. From the start, homeopathy had great features: simple conceptual system; long consultation time; and centered on the patient's life and emotional state.

As the Enlightnment entered the dark rooms of hospitals, homeopathy declined in popularity.
