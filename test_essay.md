# Homeopathy

This is not an essay on the scientific validity of Homeopathy. The scientific validation arena is best left to explanations of reality that aim to fight in it. You could pick your favourite collection of serious scientific studies that debunk homepathy; cite the various national health institutions that do not fund nor support it; appeal to how many deeply rooted scientific theories would have to be re-built from scratch if homepathy were true. This is of little use. Perhaps of some use to a small set of people, but these are marginal cases that call for another essay. I have no interest in convincing people to stop using homeopathy nor in indulging those who already think homepathy is scientifically invalid. What then _is_ this essay about? Well, it is about _cognitive siloing_ and how we compartmentalize world views. 

Homeopathy is first a binary take on the possibilities of handling diseases. Homeo-pathy for "like cures like" and Alo-Pathy for its complement. Splitting the world of ideas make it seem that both sets deserve equal standing. Of course we can always split the world into the set _for_ a position and the set _against_ a position. Evidence-based medicine and alternative medicine are two sets of approaches, but to confront them is to make a category mistake. They belong to very different ways of explaining reality. As wil see the resolution comes not from confronting them, but from udnerstanding the motives behind the split.
